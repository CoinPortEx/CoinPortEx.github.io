<i>“Huobi Eco Chain (Heco) is a decentralized and cost-efficient public chain that Ethereum developers can easily get started with and smart contracts are seamlessly compatible.” Heco has built a developed Defi ecosystem, with wallets, assets, and applications rankings. Users can easily experience the latest DApps.</i>

Heco was developed based on Ethereum but improves cross-chain functionality as well as low gas fees. It helps reduce costs and optimizes user experience with the cross-chain asset transfer.
