CoinPort will deploy a wallet upgrade for the system and will undergo maintenance. All deposits, withdrawals, spot trading, and promotion services will be suspended for approximately 4 hours on 18th March 2021 from 12:00-16:00 (UTC).

## Note:

CoinPort members will not be able to log in nor use any service during this maintenance period.

Open orders on CoinPort will not be cancelled throughout the maintenance process. Your deposit addresses will be not changed after the maintenance is complete.

You will be notified once the system maintenance is complete. Rest assured that all usersâ€™ funds are safe.

We apologize for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience.
