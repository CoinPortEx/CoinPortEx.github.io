## CoinPort Exchange Platform Upgrade

This week an upgrade to the CoinPort exchange technology platform went live.

The platform upgrade included changes to enhance and extend the user experience:
- Internal Transfers</b> - members can easily and instantly transfer digital assets to other members internally, without the need for external transactions and blockchain fees.
- Instant Swaps</b> - members can swap between all digital assets supported on CoinPort.
- Multi-chain Support</b> - where coins and tokens exist on more than one blockchain, for example Ethereum and HECO, members can choose the desired blockchain for deposits and withdraws.
- Airdrops</b> - Airdrops can now be performed on CoinPort for a wide range of blockchain projects.

Our plans for 2023 include adding an NFT marketplace and support for popular gaming tokens.

During 2023 CoinPort will obtain an Australian Financial Services License (AFSL), to allow us to offer DeFi products and projects.
