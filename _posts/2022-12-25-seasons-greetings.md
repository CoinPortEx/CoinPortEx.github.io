Another year has passed and we are looking forward to a bright and positive 2023.

Hope you, family and friends had a fruitfull and prosperous year. Thankyou for continuing to support the CoinPort digital asset exchange.

What a year 2022 was! We had the DeFi/Celcius collapse, the BTC price dropping like a brick, and FTX as the biggest crypto exchange failure in history.

We continue to be very optimistic about the crypto sector future, and are confident that the additional scrutiny of our industry will lead to better regulations and a safer future for cryptocurrencies.
