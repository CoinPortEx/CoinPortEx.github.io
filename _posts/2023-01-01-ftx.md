We confirm that Coin Habour Pty Ltd has no exposure to the FTX Exchange or the FTT token.

Our highest priority is to provide an easy, friendly and safe environment for trading, storing, and investing in cryptocurrencies.

We take a very conservative approach to managing our business and your assets including:

- Not lending your assets; they are your assets, not ours
- Not holding any debt in our business
- Maintaining complete segregation of your assets, and
- Having no proprietary trading desk; we never trade against you or other clients.

As an Australian-based exchange operating on world-class technology, our priority will always be keeping your assets safe, and that will never change.
