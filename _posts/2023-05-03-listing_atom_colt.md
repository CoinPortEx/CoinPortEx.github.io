We have added two popular coins to the exchange - Cosmos (ATOM) and Collateral Network (COLT).

Transfers of these coins can be done on either the Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain blockchains, and we will add support for other blockchains in the future.

## What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?

Cosmos is a project that solves some of the “hardest problems” facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful” proof-of-work protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.

## Collateral Network (COLT)?

Collateral Network is a next-generation crowd-lending platform that allows people from around the world to borrow against real-world assets using blockchain technology. This is achieved by minting NFTs that are backed by the borrower’s physical assets, enabling the community to become fractional lenders.
