Great news for international customers. From April 2024 CoinPort will be able to offer International Payments - International funds transfer instruction (IFTI-E).<img src="https://doc.coinport.com.au/images/news/ifti.jpg" alt="IFTI" class="center" style="max-width: 280px; float: right; padding: 20px;

An IFTI-E is an <b><i>electronic funds transfer instruction (EFTI)</i></b> that is sent to or received from another country.

What this means is that international payments for our customers will be cheaper, easier and faster than using the SWIFT system.
