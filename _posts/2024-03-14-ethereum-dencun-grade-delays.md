CoinPort transfers on the Ethereum live blockchain may be delayed because of the Dencun upgrade.<img src="https://doc.coinport.com.au/news/images/eh-duncan.png" alt="Ethereum Duncan" class="center" style="max-width: 280px; float: right; padding: 20px;">

The long-awaited Dencun upgrade activated on Ethereum mainnet Wednesday at approximately 9:55 am ET â€” or the start of epoch 269568 if you are following on-chain.

A scalability-focused upgrade, Dencun features EIP-4844 or Proto-Danksharding which carves out a dedicated data channel on Ethereum for layer-2 data, dramatically reducing the transaction fees on rollups.

We apologise for any delays with Ethereum blockchain deposits and withdraws.
