# Business Name "COINPORT EXCHANGE"

## ASIC Registration of Business Name "COINPORT EXCHANGE"

### Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

Today we registered the Business Name "COINPORT EXCHANGE". Company, ownership and directors remain unchanged.

### Rebranding as "CoinPort"

Since 2024 we have been rebranding "Coin Harbour" as "CoinPort", and the business name registration is a step in that process. 

The reason for the rebranding was that "Coin Harbour" was considered too long and ambiguous as a name. Having two spelling ("Harbour" and "Harbor") options has also created confusion in some markets.
