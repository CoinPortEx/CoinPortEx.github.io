# Company Name Change (ASIC)

## Company Name Change (ASIC) from Coin Harbour Pty Ltd to CoinPort Pty Ltd

### Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)

Today we registered a name change request with ASIC from Coin Harbour Pty Ltd to CoinPort Pty Ltd.

### Other company details remain unchanged: 

|   |   |
|----|----|
| Name: | COINPORT PTY LTD |
| ACN: | 624 879 223 |
| ABN: | 12 624 879 223 |
| DUNS: | 745041557 |

### Rebranding as "CoinPort"

Since 2024 we have been rebranding "Coin Harbour" as "CoinPort", and the company name change is part of that process. 

The reason for the rebranding was that "Coin Harbour" was considered too long and ambiguous as a name. Having two spelling ("Harbour" and "Harbor") options also created confusion in some markets.
