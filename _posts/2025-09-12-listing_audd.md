# New Listing for Novatti Australian Digital Dollar (AUDD)

We are excited to announce that Novatti Australian Digital Dollar (AUDD) has been added to  CoinPort Exchange. AUDD is a fiat-backed stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Australian Dollar (AUD), designed to bridge traditional finance and blockchain for efficient, compliant digital transactions, including cross-border payments and remittances.

## What is Novatti Australian Digital Dollar (AUDD)?

Novatti Australian Digital Dollar (AUDD) is a stablecoin issued by AUDC Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of the publicly listed Novatti Group Limited (ASX: NOV), a regulated Australian fintech company overseen by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). Launched in 2022, AUDD is fully backed 1:1 by Australian Dollars held in bank reserves, ensuring redeemability and stability. 

AUDD operates on multiple blockchains for blockchain-agnostic versatility, including Stellar, XRP Ledger (XRPL), Ethereum (as an ERC-20 token), and Hedera. This multi-chain approach enables seamless integration into diverse ecosystems, supporting use cases like instant cross-border transfers, trading pairs, remittances, and Stablecoin-as-a-Service. Users can mint and redeem AUDD directly through compliant platforms, with reserves independently verifiable for transparency.

The AUDD token's primary utility is as a digital representation of AUD, facilitating low-cost, high-speed transactions while minimizing volatility risks associated with other cryptocurrencies. It supports payments via decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and integrates with Novatti's payment solutions. With a circulating supply of approximately 254,451 AUDD and no fixed maximum supply (allowing for scalable issuance based on demand), AUDD emphasizes regulatory compliance, security, and interoperability. The protocol's open design and audits align with global stablecoin standards, positioning it as a bridge to potential central bank digital currency (CBDC) explorations.
