### **Headline: Cloudflare Enters the Stablecoin Arena with Net Dollar: A Game-Changer for AI and the Evolving Crypto Landscape**

Exciting times in the world of digital assets! Just days ago, on September 25, 2025, Cloudflare—a global leader in internet infrastructure—unveiled **Net Dollar**, a groundbreaking U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin designed to power the next era of the AI-driven internet. This launch isn't just another token drop; it's a bold step toward reimagining how value moves online, rewarding creators, and enabling seamless, instant transactions in an agentic web where AI agents handle everything from booking flights to negotiating deals.

**What’s Net Dollar All About?**

At its core, Net Dollar is pegged 1:1 to the USD and backed by stable reserves, ensuring reliability and transparency. Cloudflare envisions it as the financial rail for a pay-per-use economy—think microtransactions, fractional payments, and automated AI settlements that bypass clunky traditional systems like ads and slow bank wires. As Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince put it: “The Internet’s next business model will be powered by pay-per-use, fractional payments, and microtransactions—tools that shift incentives toward original, creative content that actually adds value. By using our global network, we are going to help modernize the financial rails needed to move money at the speed of the Internet.”

This ties perfectly into the broader **rise of stablecoins in 2025**, a year that's shaping up to be transformative for the sector. Stablecoin supply has ballooned 28% year-over-year, with total transfer volumes hitting a staggering $27.6 trillion in 2024—surpassing Visa and Mastercard combined. Market cap now exceeds $250 billion as of mid-2025, up 45x since 2019, driven by adoption in cross-border payments, DeFi, and everyday finance. Fortune 500 companies are tripling down, with nearly 1 in 5 executives eyeing blockchain for core strategies—a 47% jump from last year. And with regulatory tailwinds like the GENIUS Act paving the way, barriers are crumbling: only 20% of firms now see compliance as a hurdle, down from 80% two years ago.

**The Hype Around Securing the USDH Ticker**

The stablecoin frenzy is palpable, exemplified by the intense competition for the **USDH** ticker on Hyperliquid's high-speed DEX. Major players like Paxos, Ethena (backed by BlackRock), Frax, Sky (ex-MakerDAO), and Agora threw their hats in the ring, vying for control of what could redirect billions in trading volume and Treasury yields back into the ecosystem. Native Markets ultimately snagged it, launching USDH with over $15 million pre-minted and $2 million in early volume—proving how coveted these "blue-chip" tickers are for liquidity and growth. This hype underscores the rush among tech giants and protocols alike—Walmart, Amazon, PayPal, and Stripe are all exploring or launching their own—to capture the stablecoin gold rush.

**The Future Significance for the Crypto Space**

Cloudflare's move signals a seismic shift: stablecoins aren't just crypto's on-ramp anymore—they're the backbone of a tokenized, AI-powered global economy. By enabling instant, borderless payments, Net Dollar could accelerate AI agent adoption, democratize content monetization, and even bolster USD dominance in digital finance. As stablecoins integrate with traditional finance (think tokenized Treasuries and CBDC bridges), we'll see reduced friction in remittances, DeFi yields soaring, and new models like yield-bearing stables hitting $11B+ in market cap. But it's not without risks—regulators are watching closely for stability and illicit use, though illicit flows remain under 1% of total activity. Overall, this points to a more mature, inclusive crypto ecosystem where innovation thrives under clear rules.

**Why This Matters for CoinPort and You**
