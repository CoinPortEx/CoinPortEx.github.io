<h1>Why did I not receive a deposit?</h1>

<p>Are you experiencing this issue?</p>
<ol>
    <li>I did not receive my deposit</li>
    <li>The transaction is taking a long time to be confirmed</li>
    <li>The transaction has been confirmed, but it is still not on my Yellow wallet</li>
<li>Depositing digital assets normally requires some time to be credited into your account as it requires confirmation on Blockchain. If it takes more than an hour, this might be the reason.</li>
    </ol>
<p>1. I did not receive my deposit</p>
<ol>
       <li>a. Deposit address - check if the transfer is sent to the correct deposit address generated from your wallet. You may ask the sender to provide you with the transaction ID (TXID) to track your deposit on the blockchain explorer. </li>

       <li>b. Digital asset - check if the address matches the asset that you want to be deposited. Make sure that it is in the list of supported digital assets found here.</li>

       <li>c. Minimum deposit - make sure that the deposit amount meets the required minimum. Deposits under the minimum amount may not be credited to your account. You can find the complete list of requirements here.</li>
    </ol>

<p>2. The transaction is taking a long time to be confirmed</p>
<ol>
       <li>a. The volume of transactions could slow down confirmation time on blockchain. Coingecko is a great resource where you could find the explorer site to monitor your transactions. You will need to know the HASH or transaction (Txid) for tracking.</li>
    </ol>
<p>For example, you can search for Bitcoin on Coingecko. It will show explorers that you could use to track the transaction. Please check the photo below, you will see that there are Explorers that you can use for tracking Bitcoin transactions such as blockchair.com, ledger.com, and electrum.org</p>

<p>An example of transaction information that you should be able to find on the explore such as current number confirmations on blockchain for the transaction, time that transaction has been made.</p>

<li>b. Confirmation time also depends on the fee that was paid for the transaction. Higher fees get prioritized by the miners, thus making confirmations faster.</li>
