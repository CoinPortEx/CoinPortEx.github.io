<h1>“Money can’t buy you love”</h1> – beware of "romance" that takes your cash.

My job at CoinPort is to ensure the safety and security of your personal information. Today, I want to share my growing concerns with romance scams and some top tips on how to stay safe when dating online.

Chief Information Security Officer
We wanted you to hear all the latest directly from the person who leads our team in the fight against these threats and manages all other aspects of security and protection.

These deceptive criminals prey on lonely individuals searching for love and companionship, resulting in significant monetary loss and emotional distress. We want you to be able to spot the tell-tale signs of a romance scam, spot an imposter and stay savvy on the dating sites and apps when offered any “opportunity” that seems too good to be true.

1. Recognizing the Signs:

Romance scammers are skilled at building emotional connections before exploiting them for financial gain. To protect yourself, it is crucial to be aware of the warning signs. Watch out for individuals who:

Express strong emotions and declare love very quickly.
Claim to be working or traveling overseas, making it difficult to meet in person.
Frequently make excuses to avoid video calls or in-person meetings.
Request money for emergencies, medical bills, or travel expenses.
Use poor grammar and spelling, as many scammers operate from non-English speaking countries.

2. Verify Their Identities:

Before investing your time, emotions, or money into a relationship, make sure they are who they say they are. Start with a <b><i>"reverse image"</i></b> search on their profile pictures to ensure they have not stolen profile pics from other attractive people. Scammers will create a false persona to entice you to engage with them.

Additionally, use online tools to verify email addresses, phone numbers, and social media accounts.

A good rule of thumb is that "if it would not happen in real life, it should not happen online," so if you are being targeted by "America’s Next Top Model" – which is not your normal experience, then it is likely to be a scammer. If something seems suspicious or inconsistent, trust your instincts and proceed with caution. Take notes and do not overlook any discrepancies, no matter how small they may seem. Remember, it is always better to be safe than sorry.

3. Be Aalert to Red Flags on Social Media and Dating Platforms:

Social media and dating platforms have revolutionized the way we connect with others, but they have also opened the door for scammers because of the lack of identity verification over profits. When using these platforms, protect your personal information. Be wary of individuals who ask or personal details too soon or seem overly interested in your financial status – big red flags. Be wary of scammers trying to move communication away from dating site to personal email or messaging services, as this may be a tactic being used to avoid the safety measures of dating sites and should raise immediate concerns. Remember, genuine connections are built on trust and mutual respect, not financial transactions.

4. Skepticism Towards Investment Opportunities:

Romance scammers exploit their victims by presenting lucrative investment opportunities. They may claim to have insider knowledge or promise substantial returns. To avoid falling for these ploys, approach any investment opportunity with skepticism. Research the company or individual thoroughly, checking for reviews, certifications, and any red flags. Be especially cautious if asked to invest through unconventional methods or cryptocurrency. Always consult with a legitimate financial advisor before making any investment decisions. Remember, legitimate investments are backed by research and professional advice, not by emotions or smooth talking.

5. Be Wary of Small Requests for Gifts or Cash:

Usually, they will start small - asking for help to pay a mobile bill or perhaps send some gift cards for big brands like Amazon or Apple iTunes, which are easy to sell. If anyone ever asks you to send a gift card, it is an immediate signal that they are testing your propensity to send cash. Be cautious if someone insists on using CoinPort or other cryptocurrency transactions for sending or receiving money, as these are often less traceable and irreversible. Scammers prefer these methods because it makes it harder for them to be tracked or for you to recover your funds.

As CoinPort customers, your safety is our top priority. Together, we can raise awareness and protect one another from falling victim to these criminal schemes. Stay vigilant, trust your instincts, and remember that relationships should be built on trust and transparency, not exploited for personal gain.

Next, I shared some preventive measures to help build a bigger wall around them. I encouraged my in-laws to regularly review their bank and credit card statements, and to report any unauthorized transactions immediately.

If you ever suspect elder financial abuse, you need to reach out to trusted family members, their financial institutions, or local law enforcement authorities.

Reporting suspected abuse is crucial to stop it and prevent it from happening to others. The faster that you can do this, the more chance you have of getting your money back – if that is still possible.

Our conversation about elder financial abuse was not a comfortable one, but it was necessary. You must be delicate on how you manage the concepts of both “elderly” and “abuse” - it is not fun to consider either of these things. However, the upside is enormous.

By openly discussing this issue, we can help protect our loved ones from financial exploitation.

<p>Remember, it is not just about protecting money or property - it is about safeguarding the dignity and well-being of our elder family members and helping them feel safe in a digital world that many do not understand or relish.</p>
