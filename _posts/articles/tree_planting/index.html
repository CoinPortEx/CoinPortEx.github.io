<h1>CoinPort Carbon Offset Tree-Planting Program</h1>
<h2>World first: CoinPort - carbon offset tree-planting program.</h2>

<p>For every member who joins the CoinPort platform, we will plant at least one tree to mitigate any climate change effect of participating in the digital economy.</p>

<p>Our research estimates that the electricity to support each user of a crypto exchange ranges between 5kg and 10 kg of CO2 per year. On average a tree absorbs approximately 25kg of CO2 per year.</p>

<p>CoinPort has established a tree-planting program in the western districts of Victoria that has one of the highest annual rainfall rates in southern Australia. To maximise the carbon-capture potential and environmental sustainability, a mixture of fast and slow-growing tree species are being planted.</p>

<p>The planted tree species include: Redwoods, Giant Sequoias, Sugar Maples, Canadian Maples, Golden Elms, Beech, English Oaks, Ded Oaks, Cypress, Radiata Pine, Blue Gums, Swamp Oaks, Himalayan Cedars, Norfolk Island Pines, Golden Robinia, Moreton Bay Figs, Golden Ash, London Planes and Blackwoods.</p>

<p>By planting a variety of tree species in an optimal location CoinPort aims to offset an average at least 40kg of CO2 per year for each tree.</p>

<p>So far more than 1,000 trees have been planted.</p>
