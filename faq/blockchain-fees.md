## **1. How Blockchain Fees Work**  
Blockchain fees (also called **network fees** or **gas fees**) are payments required to process transactions on a cryptocurrency network. These fees:  
- **Pay miners/validators** for securing the network.  
- **Prevent spam transactions**.  
- **Vary by blockchain** (e.g., Bitcoin vs. Ethereum).  

CoinPort **does not profit** from these feesâ€”they are paid directly to the network.

## **2. Deposit vs. Withdrawal Fees**  
| Transaction Type | Fee Structure |  
|------------------|--------------|  
| **Deposits** | **Free** (CoinPort covers costs) |  
| **Withdrawals** | **Network fee + small exchange processing fee** (see examples below) |

## **3. Fee Examples by Blockchain**  

### **Bitcoin (BTC)**  
- **Withdrawal Fee:** 0.0005 BTC (~$30 at $60k/BTC)  
- **Why?** Bitcoinâ€™s blockchain has limited space, so fees rise with demand.  

### **Ethereum (ETH) & ERC-20 Tokens**  
- **ETH Withdrawal Fee:** 0.005 ETH (~$15 at $3k/ETH)  
- **ERC-20 Token Fee:** 0.001 ETH (~$3)  
- **Why?** ETH fees (gas) depend on network congestion.  

### **Binance Smart Chain (BSC) & BEP-20 Tokens**  
- **BNB Withdrawal Fee:** 0.0005 BNB (~$0.15)  
- **BEP-20 Token Fee:** 0.0003 BNB (~$0.09)  
- **Why?** BSC is cheaper than Ethereum but less decentralized.  

### **Solana (SOL) & SPL Tokens**  
- **SOL Withdrawal Fee:** 0.001 SOL (~$0.15)  
- **SPL Token Fee:** 0.0001 SOL (~$0.015)  
- **Why?** Solanaâ€™s high throughput keeps fees low.

## **4. Why EVM Native Tokens Cost More Than Smart Contract Tokens**  
On **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, BSC, Polygon):  

### **Native Token Fees (ETH, BNB, MATIC)**  
- Require **more computational work** to transfer (handling consensus and security).  
- **Example:** Sending ETH involves base layer settlement.  

### **Smart Contract Token Fees (ERC-20, BEP-20)**  
- Run as **secondary contracts** on top of the native chain.  
- **Example:** Sending USDC only triggers a contract call, not full validation.  

ðŸ”¹ **Result:** Transferring **ETH costs more gas than USDC** on Ethereum.

## **5. How CoinPort Determines Fees**  
1. **Dynamic Adjustment:** Fees update based on **real-time network conditions**.  
2. **Cost-Coverage:** We aim to **break even** (no profit from fees).  
3. **Third-Party Audits:** Regular checks ensure fairness.  

---

## **6. Tips to Reduce Transaction Fees**  
- **Use Layer 2s:** Withdraw via **Polygon or Arbitrum** for lower ETH fees.  
- **Avoid Peak Times:** Ethereum gas spikes during NFT drops/DeFi launches.  
- **Choose Efficient Blockchains:** Solana, BSC, and Avalanche are cheaper than Ethereum.  

---

## **7. Why Fees Fluctuate**  
- **Demand:** More users = higher fees (e.g., Bitcoin halving events).  
- **Blockchain Upgrades:** Ethereumâ€™s EIP-1559 made fees more predictable.  
- **Congestion:** NFT mints and DeFi trades clog networks.
