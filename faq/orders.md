## **1. Introduction to Order Types**  
On CoinPort‚Äôs trading platform, you can place two main types of orders:  

- **Market Order** ‚Üí Buy/sell immediately at the best available price.  
- **Limit Order** ‚Üí Set a specific price for execution.  

Understanding these orders helps you trade more effectively.

## **2. Market Orders**  
### **What is a Market Order?**  
A market order executes **instantly** at the current best available price.  

### **How It Works**  
- You specify **only the amount** to buy/sell.  
- The order fills at the **best existing Bid (for sells) or Ask (for buys)**.  
- **Guarantees execution but not price** (slippage can occur in volatile markets).  

### **Example:**  
- Current Bitcoin price: **$60,000**  
- You place a **Market Buy for 0.1 BTC** ‚Üí Order fills at **$60,000** (or slightly higher if liquidity is low).  

‚úÖ **Best for:** Fast trades when price is less important than execution speed.  

---

## **3. Limit Orders**  
### **What is a Limit Order?**  
A limit order sets a **specific price** at which you want to buy or sell.  

### **How It Works**  
- You set **both price and amount**.  
- The order **only executes if the market reaches your price**.  
- **Guarantees price but not execution** (may never fill if price doesn‚Äôt hit your limit).  

### **Example:**  
- Bitcoin is at **$60,000**, but you want to buy at **$58,000**.  
- You place a **Limit Buy at $58,000**.  
- If BTC drops to **$58,000**, your order fills. Otherwise, it stays open.  

‚úÖ **Best for:** Controlling entry/exit prices and avoiding slippage.  

---

## **4. Bid vs. Ask Prices**  
### **What is the Bid Price?**  
- The **highest price buyers** are willing to pay.  
- If you **sell at market**, you get the **Bid price**.  

### **What is the Ask Price?**  
- The **lowest price sellers** are willing to accept.  
- If you **buy at market**, you pay the **Ask price**.  

### **Bid-Ask Spread**  
- The difference between Bid and Ask.  
- **Tighter spreads** = More liquidity (better for traders).  

üìä **Example Order Book:**  
| **Bid (Buyers)** | **Ask (Sellers)** |  
|------------------|------------------|  
| $59,900 (10 BTC) | $60,100 (8 BTC) |  
| $59,850 (5 BTC)  | $60,150 (12 BTC)|

## **5. How Orders Are Executed**  
### **Market Order Execution**  
1. You submit a **Market Buy/Sell**.  
2. The exchange matches you with the **best available Bid/Ask**.  
3. Order fills **immediately** (partial fills possible if liquidity is low).  

### **Limit Order Execution**  
1. You set a **price and amount**.  
2. The order enters the **order book**.  
3. It executes **only when the market reaches your price**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Limit orders may expire if not filled (unless set as "Good-Til-Cancelled").

## **6. Which Order Type Should You Use?**  

| **Scenario** | **Recommended Order** |  
|-------------|----------------------|  
| Need instant execution? | **Market Order** |  
| Want precise control over price? | **Limit Order** |  
| Trading high-volatility coins? | **Limit Order (to avoid slippage)** |  
| Large trade in a low-liquidity market? | **Limit Order (to minimize price impact)** |  

---

## **7. Common Trading Scenarios**  
### **A. Buying the Dip**  
- Use a **Limit Buy below current price** (e.g., BTC at $58,000 instead of $60,000).  

### **B. Quick Exit During a Crash**  
- **Market Sell** ensures fast execution (but may get a worse price).  

### **C. Setting Profit Targets**  
- **Limit Sell** at a desired take-profit level (e.g., sell ETH at $4,000).  

---

## **8. Risk Management Tips**  
‚úÖ **Use Stop-Loss Orders** (automatically sell if price drops too far).  
‚úÖ **Avoid huge Market Orders in illiquid markets** (prevents slippage).  
‚úÖ **Monitor open Limit Orders** (cancel if market conditions change).
