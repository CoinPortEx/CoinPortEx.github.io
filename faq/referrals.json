            "content": "The Affiliate Program and Referral Program are two equally great initiatives but they do have differences. Therefore, itâ€™s best to understand both to see which one is suitable for you. The Referral Program rewards the referrer and the referee with a once off payment of $10 AUD worth of Bitcoin each. Being a part of the Affiliate Program is different as you will not receive a once off $10 Bitcoin reward. Instead, you will earn ongoing commissions from your affiliate based on their trading fees. For more information regarding both programs, see our help article here."
