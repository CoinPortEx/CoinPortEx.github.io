# Reporting Cryptocurrency Fraud or Scams

At CoinPort, we take the security of our customers and their assets seriously. If you suspect you've fallen victim to a cryptocurrency fraud or scam, follow these steps immediately to protect your funds and personal information.

## Immediate Actions to Take

1. **Contact CoinPort Support**  
   - Notify our support team immediately via:  
     - Email: [security@coinport.com.au](mailto:security@coinport.com.au)  
     - Phone: [Insert Customer Support Number]  
   - Provide details of the suspected fraud (transaction IDs, wallet addresses, communication with scammers).

2. **Freeze Your Account**  
   - If you suspect unauthorized access, request an account freeze through our platform or customer support to prevent further transactions.

3. **Change Your Security Credentials**  
   - Update your CoinPort password and enable two-factor authentication (2FA) if not already active.  
   - Revoke any API keys if you use third-party trading tools.

## Reporting to Authorities

4. **File a Report with Australian Authorities**  
   - **Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC):** [ReportCyber](https://www.cyber.gov.au/report)  
   - **Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC):** [Report misconduct](https://asic.gov.au)  
   - **Local Police:** File a report with your state/territory police, especially if significant funds are involved.

5. **Report to Scamwatch**  
   - Submit details to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) via [Scamwatch](https://www.scamwatch.gov.au).

## Additional Protective Measures

6. **Monitor Your Accounts**  
   - Check linked bank accounts, emails, and other exchanges for suspicious activity.  
   - Consider a credit report check if personal data was shared.

7. **Beware of Recovery Scams**  
   - Fraudsters may pose as "recovery agents" offering to reclaim your funds for a feeâ€”this is another scam. Only trust official channels.

8. **Educate Yourself**  
   - Review our [Security Guidelines](/security) to prevent future incidents.  
   - Learn common scam tactics (e.g., phishing, fake giveaways, impersonation).

## How CoinPort Can Help

- We may investigate suspicious transactions but cannot guarantee fund recovery.  
- We cooperate with law enforcement upon request (e.g., providing transaction records).
