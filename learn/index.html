                <p>In the crypto area, a DEX is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows users to buy and sell crypto through direct peer-to-peer transactions. It works in a decentralized way, without relying on a central authority.</p>

            <h2>Layer 1 - Blockchain Solutions</h2>
                <p>What Layer-1 blockchain solutions are and what their purpose is. Examples of the most common Layer-1 solutions.</p>
                <p>Given the increasing usage of cryptocurrencies in everyday life, the need for blockchain layers has also grown. Such layers are necessary for ensuring higher network security and speed, better recordkeeping, and so on. Here is where Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions come into play.</p>
                <p>When talking about a decentralized system, a Layer-1 network refers to a blockchain. The purpose of the solutions that fall into this category is to improve the base protocol itself in order to make scalability possible. Layer-2 solutions are networks or technologies that operate on top of an underlying blockchain protocol to improve efficiency and scalability.</p>

            <h2>What is Defi?</h2>
                <p>What DeFi is, what sets it apart from traditional finance, what components does it have, and what experts believe about investing in it.</p>
                <p>DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance and it represents an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, especially Ethereum. DeFi allows you to do pretty much everything that a bank would, such as earn interest, buy insurance, lend or borrow, trade assets or derivatives, and so on.</p>
                <p>But unlike traditional finance, DeFi works faster, it doesnâ€™t ask you to deal with paperwork, nor does it rely on a third party to control everything. As is the case with crypto, DeFi is global, peer-to-peer, pseudonymous, and open to everybody.</p>

            <h2>Web 3.0 Explained</h2>
            <p>What Web 3.0 is and what makes it different from Web 2.0including its benefits.
            <p>The third generation of the internet is aimed at being an open, intelligent, decentralized internet. It is also referred to as the Decentralized Web, where data will be interconnected in a decentralized way. Internet applications and services will be powered by distributed ledger technology, with the most common one being the blockchain.</p>  
            <p> Also, AI and machine-learning algorithms will play a crucial role. The aim is to use them to provide faster, more relevant data to end-users. That is why Web 3.0 is also called the Semantic Web. .</p>
