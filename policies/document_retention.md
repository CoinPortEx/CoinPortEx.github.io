# CoinPort Document Retention Policy

## Reasons for Policy

The corporate information of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd is important to how it conducts business and manages employees.

Federal law requires Coin Harbour Pty Ltd to retain certain records, usually for a specific amount of time. The accidental or intentional destruction of these records during their specified retention periods could result in the following consequences for Coin Harbour Pty Ltd and/or its employees:

* Fines and penalties.
* Loss of rights.
* Obstruction of justice charges.
* Inference of spoliation of evidence and spoliation tort claims.
* Contempt of court charges.
* Serious disadvantages in litigation.

Coin Harbour Pty Ltd must retain certain records because they contain information that:

* Serves as Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s corporate memory.
* Has enduring business value (for example, it provides a record of a business transaction, evidences Coin Harbour
  Pty Ltd's rights or obligations, protects Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s legal interests or ensures operational continuity).
* Must be kept to satisfy legal, accounting or other regulatory requirements.

Coin Harbour Pty Ltd prohibits the inappropriate destruction of any records, files, documents, samples and other forms of information. This policy is in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, under which it is a crime to change, conceal, falsify or destroy any record with the intent to impede or obstruct any official or government proceeding. Therefore, this policy is part of a company-wide system for the review, retention and destruction of records Coin Harbour Pty Ltd creates or receives in connection with the business it conducts.

## Types of Documents

This policy explains the differences among records, disposable information and confidential information belonging to others.

### Records.

A record is any type of information created, received or transmitted in the transaction of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s business, regardless of physical format. Examples of where the various types of information are located are:

* Appointment books and calendars.
* Audio and video recordings.
* Computer programs.
* Contracts.
* Electronic files.
* E-mails.
* Handwritten notes.
* Invoices.
* Letters and other correspondence.
* Magnetic tape.
* Memory in cell phones and PDAs.
* Online postings, such as on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Vine and other sites.
* Performance reviews.
* Test samples.
* Voicemails.

Therefore, any paper records and electronic files, including any records of donations made online, that are part of any of the categories listed in the Records Retention Schedule contained in the Appendix to this policy, must be retained for the amount of time indicated in the Records Retention Schedule. A record must not be retained beyond the period indicated in the Record Retention Schedule, unless a valid business reason (or a litigation hold or other special situation) calls for its continued retention. If you are unsure whether to retain a certain record, contact the Records Management Officer or the Legal Department.

### Disposable Information.

Disposable information consists of data that may be discarded or deleted at the discretion of the user once it has
served its temporary useful purpose and/or data that may be safely destroyed because it is not a record as defined
by this policy. Examples may include:

* Duplicates of originals that have not been annotated.
* Preliminary drafts of letters, memoranda, reports, worksheets and informal notes that do not represent significant steps or decisions in the preparation of an official record.
* Books, periodicals, manuals, training binders and other printed materials obtained from sources outside of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd and retained primarily for reference purposes.
* Spam and junk mail.

### Confidential Information Belonging to Others.

Any confidential information that an employee may have obtained from a source outside of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd, such
as a previous employer, must not, so long as such information remains confidential, be disclosed to or used by Coin
Harbour Pty Ltd. Unsolicited confidential information submitted to Coin Harbour Pty Ltd should be refused, returned
to the sender where possible and deleted, if received via the internet.

## Mandatory Compliance

Responsibility of All Employees. Coin Harbour Pty Ltd strives to comply with the laws, rules and regulations by which it is governed and with recognized compliance practices. All company employees must comply with this policy, the Records Retention Schedule and any litigation hold communications. Failure to do so may subject Coin Harbour Pty Ltd, its employees and contract staff to serious civil and/or criminal liability. An employee’s failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary sanctions, including suspension or termination.

Reporting Policy Violations. Coin Harbour Pty Ltd is committed to enforcing this policy as it applies to all forms of records. The effectiveness of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s efforts, however, depends largely on employees.

If you are not comfortable bringing the matter up with your immediate supervisor, or do not believe the supervisor has dealt with the matter properly, you should raise the matter with the Compliance Manager. If employees do not report inappropriate conduct, Coin Harbour Pty Ltd may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action. No one will be subject to and Coin Harbour Pty Ltd prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimidation or retaliation for reporting incidents of inappropriate conduct of any kind, pursuing any record destruction claim or cooperating in related investigations.

**Storage**. Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s records must be stored in a safe, secure and accessible manner. Any document and financial files that are essential to Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s business operations during an emergency must be duplicated and/or backed up at least once per week and maintained off site.

**Destruction.** Coin Harbour Pty Ltd’s [Records Management Officer/OTHER OFFICER/MANAGER] is responsible for the continuing process of identifying the records that have met their required retention period and supervising their destruction. The destruction of confidential, financial and personnel-related records must be conducted by shredding if possible. Non-confidential records may be destroyed by recycling. The destruction of electronic records must be coordinated with the IT Department.

The destruction of records must stop immediately upon notification from [the Legal Department] that a litigation hold is to begin because Coin Harbour Pty Ltd may be involved in a lawsuit or an official investigation (see next paragraph). Destruction may begin again once the Legal Department lifts the relevant litigation hold.

## Litigation Holds and Other Special Situations

Coin Harbour Pty Ltd requires all employees to fully comply with its published records retention schedule and
procedures as provided in this policy. All employees should note the following general exception to any stated
destruction schedule: If you believe, or [the Legal Department] informs you, that Coin Harbour Pty Ltd records are
relevant to current litigation, potential litigation (that is, a dispute that could result in litigation),
government investigation, audit or other event, you must preserve and not delete, dispose, destroy or change those
records, including e-mails, until [the Legal Department] determines those records are no longer needed. This
exception is referred to as a litigation hold or legal hold, replaces any previously or subsequently established
destruction schedule for those records. If you believe this exception may apply, or have any questions regarding
whether it may possibly apply, please contact [the Legal Department].

In addition, you may be asked to suspend any routine document disposal procedures in connection with certain other
types of events, such as the merger of Coin Harbour Pty Ltd with another organization or the replacement of Coin
Harbour Pty Ltd’s information technology systems.
