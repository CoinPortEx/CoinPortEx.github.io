# CoinPort Digital Asset Listing Policy

----------

## 1. Introduction and Purpose

With the mission to digitize and to create better transaction networks for the world whether it is for currency, asset, or anything of value. To support this, we've developed this **Digital Asset Framework**, which sets the standards for how we evaluate digital assets for listing on our platform. This framework also guides our decisions to always safeguard our customers' best interests.

Please note that CoinPort does not endorse any digital assets. We reserve the absolute right to **list, decline to list, or de-list** any asset for trading, regardless of whether it meets the standards specified here. This Framework is subject to ongoing review and improvement.

----------

## 2. Our Evaluation Process

Before approving any digital asset for listing, we conduct a thorough evaluation based on three primary criteria:

1.  **Mandatory Compliance & Foundational Requirements:** These are the core legal, regulatory, and security prerequisites that an asset must meet.
2.  **Technical and Operational Feasibility:** We assess the asset's underlying technology and the project's operational capabilities.
3.  **Listing Committee Scoring:** CoinPort's dedicated Listing Committee conducts a qualitative and quantitative review.

Additionally, we conduct **periodic evaluations** of all listed assets to ensure ongoing compliance and suitability.

Its sole purpose is to provide general information and is presented "as is" without any representation or warranty, whether express, implied, or statutory.

### 4.4 Whitepaper

A necessary report or guide that concisely informs readers about the asset’s project details and goals.

### 4.5 Legal and Compliance

-   **Know Your Customer (KYC):** A proper KYC procedure must have been conducted during the asset's Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or equivalent fundraise.
-   **Compliance Duties:** The asset's listing must not negatively impact CoinPort’s compliance with its **Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policy**.
-   **CoinPort User Agreement Adherence:** The project, asset, and its application must not violate our User Agreement, specifically **Appendix 1: Prohibited Use, Prohibited Businesses, and Conditional Use**.

### 4.6 Roadmap

A clear timeline outlining the project's stages and milestones, demonstrating sound business logic.

### 4.7 Market Circulation

Comprehensive information on the number and supply of the asset.

### 4.8 Market Demand & Community

-   **Investment Interest:** The project or asset should ideally have received investment from notable firms or hedge funds with experience in crypto-related projects.
-   **Customer Demand:** The demand from CoinPort's customer base is carefully considered.
-   **Community Activity:** A strong and transparent community where developers, users, and founders actively interact is preferred.

### 4.9 Economic Incentives

### 4.10 Token Structure and Sales

-   **Fair Distribution:** Efforts to achieve an equitable distribution of tokens (e.g., setting a purchase limit per user) are encouraged.
-   **Security:** Strong security protocols are required to mitigate risks of hacks, scams, theft of funds, and other illegal activities.
-   **Transparency:** The team should be responsive to feedback or questions about the project’s token sale and its applications in various forums.
-   **Supply:** A fixed percentage of the asset’s total supply should be sold, and the proportion sold in relation to the total supply should be fully transparent to all ecosystem participants, or it should represent a clear inflation rate.
-   **Team Ownership:** A lock-up period and a vesting schedule for team-owned tokens are highly preferred to ensure economic incentive for network improvement.
