# Politically Exposed Persons (PEP) Policy  
**Effective Date**: 05/06/2025  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Owner**: Compliance Team, CoinPort  

## 1. Purpose  
CoinPort is committed to maintaining robust Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing (AML/CTF) controls in accordance with Australian laws, including the *Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006* (AML/CTF Act). This policy outlines CoinPortâ€™s approach to identifying, assessing, and managing risks associated with Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) to mitigate potential money laundering and terrorist financing threats.  

## 2. Scope  
This policy applies to:  
- All customers (individuals and entities) of CoinPort.  
- Employees, contractors, and third-party service providers engaged in customer onboarding or due diligence.  

## 3. Definition of a PEP  
A **Politically Exposed Person (PEP)** is an individual who holds or has held a prominent public position, domestically or internationally, and may pose a higher risk of corruption, bribery, or financial crime due to their influence.  

### 3.1 Categories of PEPs  
- **Domestic PEPs**: Individuals holding prominent roles in Australian government or public offices (e.g., MPs, judges, senior military officials).  
- **Foreign PEPs**: Individuals holding equivalent positions in foreign governments or international organisations.  
- **International Organisation PEPs**: Senior members of international bodies (e.g., UN, IMF, World Bank).  
- **Family Members & Close Associates**: Immediate family (spouse, children, parents) or individuals closely linked to a PEP.  

## 4. PEP Identification & Due Diligence  

### 4.1 Customer Onboarding  
- All new customers must undergo identity verification and screening against PEP databases (e.g., World-Check, Dow Jones).  
- Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) is required for confirmed or suspected PEPs.  

### 4.2 Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)  
For PEPs, CoinPort will:  
1. Obtain senior management approval before establishing a business relationship.  
2. Verify the source of wealth and funds.  
3. Conduct ongoing monitoring of transactions and account activity.  
4. Reassess risk ratings annually or upon material changes.  

## 5. Risk Mitigation Measures  
- **Restricted Services**: PEPs may be subject to limitations on certain high-risk products.  
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Unusual or high-value transactions will trigger additional reviews.  
- **Documentation**: All PEP-related decisions and investigations must be recorded in the AML/CTF compliance register.  

## 6. Reporting Obligations  
- Suspicious Matter Reports (SMRs) must be filed with AUSTRAC if illicit activity is suspected.  
- PEP status alone does not constitute suspicious activity but warrants heightened scrutiny.  

## 7. Training & Awareness  
- All employees handling customer onboarding or compliance must complete annual AML/CTF training, including PEP identification procedures.  

## 8. Record Keeping  
- PEP-related records must be retained for **7 years** per AML/CTF Act requirements.  

## 9. Policy Review  
This policy will be reviewed annually or following regulatory changes.
