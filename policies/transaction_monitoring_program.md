This **Transaction Monitoring Program (TMP)** ensures:  
- Detection and reporting of suspicious transactions.  
- Compliance with AUSTRAC’s regulatory requirements.  
- Prevention of financial crime (money laundering, terrorism financing, fraud, and sanctions evasion).

## **3. Transaction Monitoring Framework**  

### **3.1. Risk-Based Approach**  
- High-risk customers (e.g., Politically Exposed Persons, high-volume traders) undergo **enhanced due diligence (EDD)** and stricter monitoring.  
- Low-risk customers are subject to standard monitoring.  

### **3.2. Monitoring Systems & Tools**  
- **KYCAID** – Used for **customer identity verification (KYC)**.  
- **KYCAIC** – Implements **Know Your Transaction (KYT)** for real-time blockchain analysis.  
- **Automated Transaction Monitoring System (TMS)** – Flags unusual activity based on predefined rules.  

### **3.3. Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) & Red Flags**  
Transactions are monitored for:  
- **Unusual Transaction Patterns:**  
  - Rapid deposits/withdrawals with no clear purpose.  
  - Structuring (breaking large transactions into smaller amounts to avoid reporting).  
  - Transactions linked to high-risk jurisdictions.  
- **Anomalous Behavior:**  
  - Mismatched customer profiles (e.g., a low-income user suddenly trading large volumes).  
  - Use of privacy coins or mixers (if permitted by Coin Harbour’s policy).  
- **Sanctions & PEPs:**  
  - Transactions involving blacklisted wallets or sanctioned entities.

## **4. Procedures**  

### **4.1. Real-Time Monitoring**  
- All transactions are screened against:  
  - **Sanctions lists** (e.g., OFAC, AUSTRAC).  
  - **KYT alerts** (unusual wallet activity, darknet links).  
- **Automated holds** are placed on suspicious transactions pending review.  

### **4.2. Post-Transaction Review**  
- **Daily batch reviews** of flagged transactions by the Compliance Team.  
- **Manual investigation** where automated systems generate alerts.  

### **4.3. Suspicious Matter Reporting (SMR)**  
- If a transaction is deemed suspicious, an **SMR is filed with AUSTRAC** within 24–72 hours.  
- **Internal documentation** is maintained for audit purposes.  

### **4.4. Record Keeping**  
- All monitoring data, alerts, and investigation notes are stored for **7 years** per AML/CTF Act requirements.
