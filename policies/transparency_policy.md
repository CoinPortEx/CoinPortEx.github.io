We are committed to being responsive and accountable to the people we provide our services to, and we ensure the rights of national authorities to obtain information as required.

We created this Transparency Policy ("Policy") to regulate the processing of requests by national authorities and the provision of information requested whether it is legal.

The terms in this Policy are used in accordance with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and Anti-Money Laundering Policy.

you confirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the information provided in this Policy. Please leave the website and do not use any services if you do not agree with the terms and conditions laid down in this Policy.

We do not provide our services (and our website is not intended) for people under the age of 18, so we do not intentionally obtain information about anyone under the age of 18.

1.  GENERAL

We are registered with AUSTRAC in Australia. CoinPort is also an obliged entity according to the Australian Law on the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.

Any person or organization with the legally delegated or invested authority, capacity, or power to perform a designated function ("Competent authority") has the right to submit requests for data to CoinPort via email:  [support@coinport.com.au](mailto:support@coinport.com.au)  (for more details see Section 2).

We assist all Competent authorities to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing by providing information in response to requests in a timely manner, all while complying with the duties, obligations, and restrictions imposed by law.

1.1. Users' requests

Natural persons and legal entities may also obtain necessary data via email:  [support@coinport.com.au](mailto:support@coinport.com.au). We can only reveal information and data about the petitioner's conduct as our User. Remember that when you submit a request to us, we may demand certain information to verify your identity.

2.  HOW TO SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR DATA?

Any information request must be formal, written in English, and include a genuine email address to which we can respond. An email that is clearly affiliated with the Competent Authority to be considered valid.

2.1. Competent authority

The request for data must include the following details:

Detailed information about Competent authority; full name and identification information of the person in charge; Competent authority's contact information (including official email, postal address, and phone number); description of types of data that Competent authority needs to receive; date of request, the signature of the responsible person, and official seal (if applicable). Please note that we require a judicial order to disclose the information in respect of a certain account unless express consent has been given by that user. Only emails originating from an official law enforcement email address (domain) will be responded to.

Please note that only a court order presented to us via e-mail address can result in the seizure and forfeiture of assets on the User's account. The court order must be in English (or translated into). A digital wallet is necessary to carry out the forfeiture of someone's digital property.

Please be aware that if you represent a Competent authority outside of Australia, you may be subject to the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaties procedures.

We will respond to your request as quickly as possible, but time is needed to examine it properly, so please let us at least 15 working days to do so.

2.2. Users

The request for data must include the following details:

your full name and contact information; your CoinPort's Account details ; contact information (email used in registration, phone number); description of types of data that you would like to receive ; date of request. Please note, that we may ask you to supplement the request with additional information if needed.

We have one month to respond to a reasonable request from you. If necessary, the period can be extended for another two months, depending on the complexity and quantity of requests.

3.  RELIEF FROM LIABILITY

We, our employees, representatives, or anyone acting in our name are not liable for any damage caused by the Competent authority's notification of suspicions of money laundering or terrorist financing while performing the requirements imposed by relevant legislation.

Our good faith performance of the notification obligation arising from relevant legislation, as well as our communication of relevant data, is not deemed an infringement of the confidentiality requirement imposed by law or contract, and no liability imposed by law or contract is imposed on the person who performed the notification obligation for disclosure of the information.

The information provided in response to the request is gathered and provided to the maximum extent and all possible accuracy. Nothing, though, can be guaranteed to be free of faults, inaccuracies, misrepresentations, or failures in such data. THEREFORE, NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR OUTSOURCED ADVISORS MAKE ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR GUARANTEE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE INFORMATION AND, IN PARTICULAR, AS TO THE INFORMATION'S ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS.

Nothing in this Policy should be interpreted as indicating a refusal to disclose the requested information.
