# CoinPort Whistleblower Policy

## Overview

At Coin Harbour Pty Ltd (“the Company”) we are guided by our company values. These values are the foundation of how we conduct ourselves and interact with each other, our clients, members, suppliers, shareholders and other stakeholders.

The Company encourages the reporting of any instances of suspected unethical, illegal, corrupt, fraudulent or undesirable conduct involving the Company’s business and provides protections and measures to individuals who make a disclosure in relation to such conduct without fear of victimisation or reprisal.

This policy will be provided to all employees and oﬃcers of the Company upon commencement of their employment or engagement.

Employee;

* Director;
* Contractor (including sub-contractors and employees of contractors); Supplier (including employees of suppliers);
* Consultant; Auditor; Associate; and
* Relative, dependant, spouse, or dependant of a spouse of any of the above.
* This policy is intended to apply to the above persons in all countries in which the Company operates a business.

## Reportable Conduct

* A danger, or represents a danger to the public or ﬁnancial system; Harassment, discrimination, victimisation or bullying.

Any disclosures that do not fall within the deﬁnition of Reportable Conduct, will not qualify for protection under the Act It will be at the Company’s discretion whether it considers there is a reasonable suspicion that the Reportable Conduct is occurring and/or whether the conduct constitutes “misconduct or improper state of aﬀairs” under the Act.

For the avoidance of doubt, Reportable Conduct does not include personal work-related grievances. A personal
work-related grievance is a grievance about any matter in relation to a staﬀ member’s current or former
employment, having implications (or tending to have implications) for that person personally and that do not have broader implications for the Company. Examples of personal work-related grievances are as follows:`

* A decision relating to the engagement, transfer or promotion of the staﬀ member; A decision relating to the terms and conditions of engagement of the staﬀ member;
* A decision to suspend or terminate the engagement of the staﬀ member, or otherwise to discipline the staﬀ member.
* Personal work-related grievances should be reported to your manager or in accordance with the Company’s Grievance Policy.
