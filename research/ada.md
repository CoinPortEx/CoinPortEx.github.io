# What Is Cardano (ADA)?

**Cardano (ADA)**, launched in September 2017, is the native cryptocurrency of the **Cardano blockchain**, a decentralized, open-source Layer 1 blockchain designed for smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps). Founded by Charles Hoskinson, [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) emphasizes academic rigor, sustainability, and scalability. ADA powers transaction fees, staking, and governance, supporting a growing ecosystem with $1.2B in total value locked (TVL).

## Key Features
- **High Scalability**: Processes up to 1,000 transactions per second (TPS) with Hydra scaling, targeting millions TPS.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.17, competitive for DeFi and NFT use.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Ouroboros consensus ensures energy efficiency, with 3,000+ stake pools.
- **Ecosystem**: Hosts 138,000+ smart contracts, 8,000+ tokens, and projects like SNEK and World Mobile.

## ADA Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking rewards, and governance voting in the Voltaire era.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~36 billion ADA, with a max supply of 45 billion.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Cardano;

# Who Are the Founders of Cardano?

Cardano was co-founded by **Charles Hoskinson**, **Jeremy Wood**, and **Aggelos Kiayias** in 2015, with development led by Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK). Funded by a $60M ICO in 2017, Cardano is supported by the Cardano Foundation and IOHK. Hoskinson, a former Ethereum co-founder, drives its research-first approach.

# What Makes Cardano Unique?

Cardano stands out for its academic approach:

- **Research-Driven**: Peer-reviewed protocols, with 190+ academic papers, ensure robust design.
- **Ouroboros PoS**: Energy-efficient consensus, distributing rewards across 3,000+ stake pools.
- **Voltaire Governance**: Introduces a treasury and voting system, making Cardano self-sustaining.
- **Interoperability**: Unreal Engine 4/5 plugins and cross-chain bridges enhance dApp development.

# ADA Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Chang Hard Fork (Q1 2025)**: Completed Voltaire transition, enabling community governance and treasury voting.
- **Hydra Scaling (June 2025)**: Boosted TPS to 1,000, with sub-second finality for DeFi and gaming dApps.
- **ETF Proposals (June 2025)**: Nasdaq proposed adding ADA to Hashdex Crypto ETF, increasing volume by 33.8% to $776M daily.

# How Is ADA Secured?

Cardano and ADA are secured through:

- **Ouroboros PoS**: Validators stake ADA to secure the network, with rewards for honest behavior.
- **Decentralized Stake Pools**: Over 3,000 pools globally, with no single entity controlling consensus.
- **Formal Verification**: Haskell-based code undergoes rigorous academic audits for security.
- **Governance**: ADA holders vote on upgrades, ensuring decentralized control and evolution.

# Conclusion

**Cardano (ADA)** powers a scalable, research-driven blockchain for smart contracts, DeFi, and dApps. With its Ouroboros PoS, peer-reviewed protocols, and Voltaire governance, Cardano offers a sustainable alternative to Ethereum. Recent upgrades like Hydra and ETF proposals position it for growth in the $3.5T crypto market.
