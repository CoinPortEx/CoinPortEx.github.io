# What Is Algorand (ALGO)?

**Algorand (ALGO)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Algorand blockchain, a decentralized layer-1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) platform launched in June 2019. Founded by Turing Award-winning cryptographer Silvio Micali, [Algorand](https://algorand.co/) is designed for scalability, speed, and security, supporting decentralized applications (dApps), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and financial infrastructure. With its Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS) consensus, Algorand achieves high throughput (~10,000 TPS) and instant finality, targeting enterprise and Web3 adoption. 

## Key Features
- **Pure Proof-of-Stake (PPoS)**: Requires only 1 ALGO to stake, enabling democratized participation and high security with low entry barriers.
- **High Scalability**: Processes thousands of transactions per second with sub-4-second finality and low fees (~$0.0002 per transaction).
- **Carbon Neutrality**: Maintains an eco-friendly network with minimal energy consumption compared to Proof-of-Work (PoW) chains.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Supports Python and other familiar languages for dApp and smart contract development.

## ALGO Token
- **Purpose**: Powers transactions, staking, governance, and RWA tokenization.
- **Supply**: ~8.6B ALGO in circulation, with a maximum supply of 10B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Algorand blockchain; compatible with wallets like Pera Wallet or MyAlgo for DeFi and trading [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/algorand) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/algorand/).


## Who Are the Founders of Algorand?
Algorand was founded by Silvio Micali, an MIT professor and cryptography pioneer. The Algorand Foundation, established to manage the network, conducted a $60M ICO in June 2019 at $0.24 per token. The foundation, joined by advisor Jennie Levin in 2025, drives ecosystem growth and governance.

## What Makes Algorand Unique?
Algorand stands out in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **Pure PoS (PPoS)**: Randomly selects validators with minimal staking (1 ALGO), enhancing decentralization and security.
- **RWA Leadership**: Secures 77% of on-chain stocks ($348M), surpassing Ethereum, Arbitrum, and XRP combined.
- **GENIUS Act Compliance**: Natively supports features like freeze, clawback, and reserve addresses for regulatory compliance.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Hosts dApps like Folks Finance and supports multichain functionality via Wormhole NTT.

## Algorand Network Upgrades (2024–2025)
- **Native Multichain Functionality (2025)**: Integrated Wormhole NTT via Folks Finance for cross-chain interoperability.
- **Blockchain Association Membership (2025)**: Joined to influence crypto policy and adoption.
- **Avalanche Integration (2025)**: Enhanced EVM compatibility for DeFi and dApp liquidity.

## How Is Algorand Secured?

- **PPoS Consensus**: Random validator selection ensures resistance to malicious attacks with minimal staking requirements.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Rewards are distributed to all ALGO holders every ~10 minutes, incentivizing participation.
- **Relay Nodes**: Facilitate communication without proposing/voting, enhancing network efficiency.


## Conclusion
**Algorand (ALGO)** is a scalable, secure, and eco-friendly layer-1 blockchain driving financial and Web3 infrastructure. With leadership in RWA tokenization, Algorand’s PPoS, low fees, and 2025 upgrades like multichain support and staking accessibility position it as a cornerstone for decentralized economies.
