# What Is Aptos (APT)?

**Aptos (APT)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Aptos blockchain, a decentralized layer-1 Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network launched in October 2022. Developed by Aptos Labs, founded by former Meta Diem engineers, [Aptos](https://aptosfoundation.org/) focuses on delivering a high-performance, scalable, and secure blockchain for Web3 adoption. Using the Move programming language, it powers decentralized applications (dApps), real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and DeFi solutions with a theoretical throughput of over 150,000 transactions per second (TPS). 

## Key Features
- **High Performance**: Achieves high TPS through parallel execution with the Block-STM engine, ensuring fast transaction finality (<1 second).
- **Move Language**: Utilizes the Rust-based Move programming language, designed for secure and flexible smart contract development.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Employs AptosBFT, a custom Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus for robust security and validator efficiency.
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Supports DeFi, RWAs, and dApps, with $540M+ in tokenized RWAs from partners like BlackRock and Ondo Finance.

## APT Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and enabling dApp and DeFi interactions on the Aptos network.
- **Supply**: ~644M APT in circulation, with a total supply of ~1.2B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Aptos blockchain; compatible with wallets like Petra or Martian for DeFi and trading [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/aptos) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/aptos/).


## Who Are the Founders of Aptos?
Aptos was founded by Mo Shaikh (CEO) and Avery Ching (CTO), both former Meta engineers who worked on the Diem blockchain project. After Diem’s discontinuation in January 2022, Aptos Labs raised $200M in a seed round led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), with additional backing from Binance Labs, Multicoin Capital, and others. The mainnet launched on October 18, 2022.

## What Makes Aptos Unique?
Aptos distinguishes itself in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **Parallel Execution**: Block-STM processes transactions simultaneously, boosting scalability and reducing latency.
- **Move Programming**: Offers a secure, developer-friendly language for building complex dApps and smart contracts.
- **RWA Tokenization**: Hosts over $540M in RWAs, including partnerships with BlackRock, Ondo Finance, and Pact Consortium, positioning it among the top 3 chains for RWAs.
- **DeFi and Ecosystem**: Features protocols like Thala Labs ($30M+ daily volume) and Echo Protocol ($278M in BTC assets), driving Web3 adoption.

## Aptos Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Gas Station (June 2025)**: Eliminates gas fees for users, improving UX and cost management for dApps.
- **Shelby Integration (June 2025)**: Introduces decentralized cloud-grade infrastructure for real-time data monetization, debuted at Permissionless.
- **Aave V3 Deployment (June 2025)**: AIP passed to deploy Aave V3 on Aptos, enhancing DeFi capabilities.
- **Aptos ETF Filing (June 2025)**: Bitwise amended its Aptos ETF filing, advancing institutional integration in the U.S.

## How Is Aptos Secured?
Aptos maintains robust security:
- **AptosBFT Consensus**: Automatically adjusts leader rotations to handle non-responsive validators, ensuring network reliability.
- **PoS Staking**: Validators stake APT to secure the network, with community-driven governance enhancing decentralization.
- **Move Security**: The Move language minimizes vulnerabilities in smart contracts through formal verification.


## Conclusion
**Aptos (APT)** is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain designed for scalability, security, and Web3 adoption. With its Move programming language, parallel execution, and growing ecosystem—including $540M+ in RWAs and DeFi protocols like Thala Labs and Echo Protocol—Aptos bridges traditional finance and decentralized economies.
