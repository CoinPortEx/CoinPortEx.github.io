# What Is Arbitrum (ARB)?

**Arbitrum (ARB)**, launched in March 2023, is the governance token of the [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.io/) ecosystem, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution using optimistic rollups. Developed by Offchain Labs, Arbitrum enhances Ethereum’s speed and cost-efficiency by processing transactions off-chain and batching them to the mainnet. ARB powers governance, staking, and protocol incentives, supporting a $2.6 billion total value locked (TVL) ecosystem, ranking #7 among blockchains.

## Key Features
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Executes transactions off-chain with fraud proofs, enabling ~10,000 transactions per second (TPS) and low fees.
- **Ethereum Security**: Inherits Ethereum’s proof-of-stake security, ensuring trustless operations.
- **Ecosystem**: Hosts DeFi (e.g., GMX, Uniswap V3), NFTs, and gaming, with $100 billion in DEX volume in 2025.
- **Chain Abstraction**: Supports cross-chain interactions via bridges and Arbitrum Nova for high-throughput dApps.

## ARB Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, and transaction fees in the Arbitrum DAO.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~4.9 billion ARB, with a max supply of 10 billion.
- **Contract Address**: `0x912ce59144191c1204e64559fe8253a0e49e6548` (Ethereum, addable to MetaMask), [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/arbitrum) [cmc](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/).




# Who Are the Founders of Arbitrum?

Arbitrum was developed by **Offchain Labs**, founded by **Ed Felten**, **Steven Goldfeder**, and **Harry Kalodner**, former Princeton University researchers with expertise in computer science, cryptography, and blockchain. The New York-based team launched Arbitrum One in 2021, transitioning to a decentralized DAO structure in 2023.

# What Makes Arbitrum Unique?

ARB and Arbitrum stand out for their scalability and ecosystem:

- **Low Fees**: Offers transactions 10x cheaper than Ethereum L1, with 600ms finality.
- **Arbitrum Nitro**: Enhances performance with faster block times and EVM compatibility.
- **Arbitrum Orbit**: Enables developers to deploy custom L3 chains using languages like Rust and C++.
- **DeFi Dominance**: Hosts GMX ($300B lifetime trading volume) and other protocols, driving adoption.


# ARB Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Arbitrum Orbit Expansion**: Launched L3 solutions for gaming and DeFi, increasing throughput.
- **Chain Reaction Initiative**: Spotlighted apps like GMX and Rho, boosting ecosystem visibility.
- **Validator Growth**: Expanded institutional validators for decentralized security.


# How Is ARB Secured?

ARB and the Arbitrum ecosystem are secured through:

- **Ethereum PoS**: Inherits Ethereum’s proof-of-stake security for rollup finality.
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Uses fraud proofs with a challenge period to ensure transaction validity.
- **Arbitrum DAO**: ARB holders govern upgrades and validator policies.
- **Forced Inclusion**: Ensures sequencer reliability with replacement protocols.


# Conclusion

**Arbitrum (ARB)** powers a leading Ethereum L2 blockchain, offering fast, low-cost transactions with robust security. Its Orbit L3 solutions, vibrant DeFi ecosystem, and DAO governance make it a scalability leader.
