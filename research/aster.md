## Who Are the Founders of Aster?
Aster evolved from ApolloX Finance, with roots tracing back to Aster Protocol founded in 2021 by Ervin Zhuang. The project is backed by YZi Labs (formerly Binance Labs), the family office of Binance co-founders Changpeng Zhao (CZ) and Yi He, providing strategic oversight and investment. The team focuses on compliant DeFi innovation through community governance, without a traditional ICO, emphasizing rapid iteration and high-profile partnerships.

- **CZ and YZi Backing**: Endorsement from Binance founder CZ and YZi Labs drives credibility, whale activity, and rapid adoption, flipping competitors in volume.
- **MEV Resistance and Efficiency**: Eliminates front-running via ZK tech and supports yield-bearing collateral, reducing opportunity costs compared to standard DEXs.
- **Community-First Growth**: Airdrops from APX migrations and governance rewards foster loyalty, with TVL surging to over $1B in days.
