# What Is Cosmos (ATOM)?

**Cosmos (ATOM)**, launched in March 2019, is the native cryptocurrency of the **Cosmos Hub**, the flagship blockchain of the **Cosmos Network**, a decentralized ecosystem of interoperable, application-specific blockchains. Founded by Tendermint, [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/) aims to create the “Internet of Blockchains” using the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. ATOM powers transaction fees, staking, governance, and airdrop eligibility, with $1.8B in total value locked (TVL) across the ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Interoperability**: IBC enables seamless data and asset transfers between 260+ blockchains like Osmosis and Kava.
- **High Scalability**: Processes up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with CometBFT consensus.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.01, ideal for cross-chain DeFi and dApps.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports 262+ apps, including Osmosis, Stargaze, and Injective, with 65% IBC-enabled chains.

## ATOM Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, governance voting, and airdrop rewards for stakers.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~440 million ATOM, with no max supply (inflationary model).
- **Contract Address**: Native to Cosmos Hub; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos-hub) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cosmos/). Add to wallets like Keplr or Cosmostation.

# Who Are the Founders of Cosmos?

Cosmos was co-founded by **Jae Kwon**, **Zarko Milosevic**, and **Ethan Buchman** in 2014 through Tendermint (now Ignite). Funded by a $17M ICO in 2017, the Cosmos Hub launched in 2019. The Interchain Foundation supports ecosystem growth, while Kwon stepped down as Tendermint CEO in 2020, with **Peng Zhong** leading since.

# What Makes Cosmos Unique?

Cosmos stands out for its modular architecture:

- **Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC)**: Connects “Zones” (independent blockchains) via Hubs like Cosmos Hub, reducing 4,950+ peer-to-peer connections.
- **CometBFT Consensus**: Combines Tendermint’s BFT engine for fast, developer-friendly blockchain creation.
- **Sovereign Blockchains**: Developers customize chains with full control over consensus and governance.
- **Airdrop Incentives**: Staked ATOM holders often receive airdrops from new ecosystem projects.

# ATOM Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Gaia v24 Upgrade (June 2025)**: Replaced Liquid Staking Module with x/liquid module, reducing technical debt for faster development.
- **Eureka Bridge (Q1 2025)**: Enabled fast bridging to Ethereum and beyond, boosting liquidity.
- **Interchain Security V2 (March 2025)**: Enhanced shared security for connected chains, increasing ATOM’s utility.

# How Is ATOM Secured?

Cosmos and ATOM are secured through:

- **PoS with CometBFT**: Validators stake ATOM to secure the network, with slashing for misbehaviour.
- **Decentralized Validators**: 180+ validators across the Cosmos Hub ensure economic security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Informal Systems protect IBC and dApps.
- **Governance**: ATOM stakers vote on proposals, ensuring decentralized control and upgrades.

# Conclusion

**Cosmos (ATOM)** powers the Cosmos Hub, a cornerstone of the “Internet of Blockchains,” enabling interoperability and scalability across 260+ chains. With IBC, low fees, and airdrop incentives, Cosmos drives DeFi and Web3 innovation. Recent upgrades like Gaia v24 and Eureka position ATOM for growth in the $3.5T crypto market, with bullish community sentiment for its ecosystem.
