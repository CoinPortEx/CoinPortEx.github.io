## Who Are the Founders of AUDD?
AUDD was developed by AUDC Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of Novatti Group Limited (ASX: NOV), a publicly listed Australian fintech company founded in 1999 by Peter Cook. The project is led by CEO Effie Dimitropoulos MAICD, with oversight from Novatti's executive team including CFO Ashley Sweetman. Novatti, regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), focuses on digital payments without a traditional ICO, emphasizing compliant innovation through partnerships and pilots.

## What Makes AUDD Unique?
AUDD differentiates itself among stablecoins:
- **Australian-Focused Compliance**: Fully regulated under ASIC, with 1:1 AUD reserves audited regularly, providing trust for institutional and retail users in the Asia-Pacific region.
- **Blockchain Agnosticism**: Multi-chain deployment avoids single-network risks, enabling efficient cross-border payments and integration with global ecosystems like XRPL for remittances.
- **CBDC Pilot Participation**: Selected for Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) projects like Acacia, exploring tokenized settlements and NPP interoperability, bridging fiat and digital finance.
- **Sustainability and Efficiency**: Leverages energy-efficient networks like Hedera (carbon-negative) for low-fee, high-speed transactions, outperforming traditional rails in cost and speed.
- **Real-World Utility**: Powers B2B payments, bullion trading (e.g., via Ainslie partnership), and DeFi, with growing adoption in APAC for programmable money.

## AUDD Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Hedera Launch (June 2025)**: First commercial use of Hedera Stablecoin Studio; native issuance via HTS for APAC payments, enabling $0.001 transfers and boosting adoption in remittances.
- **Project Acacia Integration (Early 2025)**: Selected by RBA and Digital Finance CRC for tokenised asset settlement and stablecoin interoperability on Hedera, enhancing NPP connectivity.
- **Expanded Chain Deployments (Q2-Q3 2025)**: Added support for Solana and upcoming XDC/BASE; partnerships like Ainslie for crypto-bullion trading increased liquidity and use cases.
- **CBDC Pilot Advancements (Ongoing 2025)**: Deeper involvement in RBA pilots, including eAUD explorations; no airdrops or burns announced, but mint/burn mechanisms ensure supply stability.
- **Partnership Growth (September 2025)**: Collaborations with HBAR Foundation and XDC Network for export propositions; TVL growth in DeFi integrations amid Australia's fintech trends.

## How Is AUDD Secured?

- **Full Reserve Backing**: 1:1 collateralized by AUD in audited bank accounts; regular third-party audits verify reserves and prevent under-collateralization.
- **Regulatory Oversight**: ASIC-regulated issuer (AUDC/Novatti) enforces KYC/AML, with transparent reporting to maintain compliance and user trust.
- **Multi-Chain Security**: Inherits native security from host networks (e.g., Hedera's aBFT consensus, XRPL's energy-efficient validation); mint/burn processes controlled by issuer to avoid over-issuance.
- **Audits and Transparency**: External audits of smart contracts and reserves; no major incidents reported, with mechanisms to burn tokens upon redemption for supply integrity.


## Conclusion
**Novatti Australian Digital Dollar (AUDD)** is a compliant, multi-chain stablecoin revolutionizing payments and remittances in Australia and beyond, with full AUD backing and regulatory assurance. 2025 developments like the Hedera launch and RBA pilots underscore its role in tokenized finance and CBDC pathways.
