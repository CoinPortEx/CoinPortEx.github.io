# What Is Avalanche (AVAX)?

**Avalanche (AVAX)**, launched in September 2020, is the native cryptocurrency of the **Avalanche blockchain**, a high-performance, decentralized Layer 1 blockchain platform designed for smart contracts and custom blockchain networks. Founded by Ava Labs, Avalanche offers scalability, speed, and interoperability, competing with Ethereum. [AVAX](https://www.avax.network/) powers transaction fees, staking, governance, and subnet creation, with $6.2B in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **High Throughput**: Processes up to 6,500 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.02, ideal for DeFi, NFTs, and gaming.
- **Tri-Chain Architecture**: Comprises X-Chain (asset exchange), C-Chain (smart contracts), and P-Chain (coordination), optimizing performance.
- **Ecosystem**: Hosts 3.8M daily transactions, 2.2M active wallets, and projects like Trader Joe, FIFA Collect, and MapleStory Universe.

## AVAX Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and creating subnets (custom blockchains).
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~422 million AVAX, with a max supply of 720 million.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Avalanche (C-Chain);  [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/avalanche/). Add to wallets like MetaMask or Core.

# Who Are the Founders of Avalanche?

Avalanche was founded by **Ava Labs**, led by **Emin Gün Sirer**, a Cornell University professor, alongside **Kevin Sekniqi** and **Maofan “Ted” Yin**. Launched with a $42M ICO in 2020, Ava Labs raised $230M in 2021 from investors like Polychain Capital and Andreessen Horowitz (a16z). The team focuses on solving the blockchain trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization.

# What Makes Avalanche Unique?

Avalanche stands out for its innovative design:

- **Subnet Architecture**: Developers create custom blockchains (subnets) tailored for specific use cases, like FIFA Collect or MapleStory Universe.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Energy-efficient consensus with 1,200+ validators, enabling low-cost, fast transactions.
- **Interoperability**: Bridges to Ethereum (e.g., SushiSwap, TrueUSD) enhance cross-chain DeFi and liquidity.
- **Gaming Focus**: Hosts AAA games like Off the Grid, with a Battle Pass NFT on Magic Eden.

# AVAX Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Retro9000 Airdrop (Q1 2025)**: Distributed AVAX rewards to active users, boosting ecosystem engagement.
- **Gaia Upgrade (June 2025)**: Improved subnet scalability, increasing TPS by 20% and reducing node requirements.
- **FIFA Collect L1 (May 2025)**: Launched a dedicated Avalanche subnet for FIFA’s on-chain collectibles.

# How Is AVAX Secured?

Avalanche and AVAX are secured through:

- **PoS Consensus**: Validators stake AVAX (minimum 2,000 AVAX) to secure the network, with slashing for misbehaviour.
- **Tri-Chain Security**: X-Chain, C-Chain, and P-Chain distribute tasks, enhancing resilience.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure dApp and subnet integrity.
- **Governance**: AVAX stakers vote on protocol upgrades, ensuring decentralized control.

# Conclusion

**Avalanche (AVAX)** powers a scalable, fast, and interoperable Layer 1 blockchain, rivaling Ethereum with its subnet architecture and low fees. With $6.2B TVL, 2.2M active wallets, and projects like FIFA Collect and MapleStory Universe, Avalanche drives DeFi, gaming, and Web3 innovation.
