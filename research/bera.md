# What Is Berachain (BERA)?

**Berachain (BERA)** is the native gas and staking token of Berachain, an EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain launched in February 2025. Built with the Cosmos SDK and BeaconKit, [Berachain](https://www.berachain.com/) introduces a novel Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) consensus mechanism, aligning network security with liquidity provision. Featuring a tri-token system—BERA (gas/staking), BGT (non-transferable governance), and HONEY (stablecoin)—Berachain supports DeFi, real-world asset (RWA) tokenization, and NFTs, with a focus on modular design to reduce liquidity fragmentation. 

## Key Features
- **Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL)**: Incentivizes validators to stake BERA (250K–10M) and direct BGT rewards to liquidity pools, enhancing DeFi efficiency.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Fully compatible with Ethereum tooling, enabling seamless dApp migration and development.
- **Tri-Token System**: BERA handles fees and staking, BGT enables governance, and HONEY serves as a native stablecoin for DeFi.
- **High Performance**: Achieves 10,000+ TPS with sub-second finality via Cosmos SDK and PoL consensus.

## BERA Token
- **Purpose**: Facilitates transaction fees, staking, and validator security; BGT (non-transferable) handles governance, HONEY supports DeFi.
- **Supply**: ~120M BERA in circulation, with a maximum supply of ~500M. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Berachain blockchain; compatible with wallets like MetaMask or Keplr for DeFi and staking [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/berachain) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/berachain/).


## Who Are the Founders of Berachain?
Berachain evolved from the Bong Bears NFT collection, with no named founders but a pseudonymous team driving development. Backed by Polychain Capital, Outlier Ventures, and Binance Labs, Berachain raised over $100M, with 48.9% of the 500M BERA genesis supply allocated to community initiatives. The BGT Foundation oversees phased governance, transitioning to full community control.

## What Makes Berachain Unique?

- **Proof-of-Liquidity**: Aligns validator staking with liquidity provision, reducing fragmentation and boosting DeFi yields.
- **Tri-Token Model**: Separates gas (BERA), governance (BGT), and stablecoin (HONEY) functions for optimized economics.
- **NFT Origins**: Evolved from Bong Bears NFTs, fostering a vibrant community and NFT ecosystem.
- **Modular Design**: Built with BeaconKit, enabling tailored L1 blockchains with full EVM compatibility.

## Berachain Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Bectra Upgrade (March 2025)**: Enhanced smart account functionality, enabling every wallet to operate as a smart contract for DeFi.
- **HONEY Stablecoin Launch (April 2025)**: Fully deployed HONEY as a native stablecoin, integrated with DEXs like Kodiak V3.
- **Liquidity Vault Expansion (May 2025)**: Scaled beraSTONE and beraSBTC vaults with StakeStone, increasing TVL to ~$500M.
- **Cross-Chain Bridge Optimization (June 2025)**: Improved Stargate bridge for USDC.E, boosting interoperability with Ethereum and Solana.

## How Is Berachain Secured?

- **PoL Consensus**: Validators stake BERA and earn BGT, with stake caps and concave emissions preventing centralization.
- **Cosmos SDK Security**: Inherits secure, validator-driven PoS with instant finality.
- **Threshold Signatures**: Protects liquidity vaults, reducing attack vectors.


## Conclusion
**Berachain (BERA)** is an innovative EVM-compatible layer-1 blockchain redefining DeFi with its Proof-of-Liquidity consensus and tri-token system. Berachain’s 2025 upgrades like the Bectra upgrade and HONEY launch position it as a leader in scalable, liquidity-driven Web3 ecosystems.
