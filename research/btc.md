# What Is Bitcoin (BTC)?

**Bitcoin (BTC)**, launched in January 2009, is the first and largest cryptocurrency by market cap, operating on the **Bitcoin blockchain**, a decentralized, open-source Layer 1 blockchain. Created by the pseudonymous **Satoshi Nakamoto**, [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/) enables peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries, serving as a digital store of value and medium of exchange. BTC powers transaction fees, mining rewards, and ecosystem growth.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Ledger**: A distributed blockchain records all transactions, maintained by nodes globally.
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Miners solve complex puzzles to validate transactions, ensuring security.
- **Finite Supply**: Capped at 21 million coins, with ~19.8 million in circulation as of June 2025.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports sidechains (e.g., Stacks), wrapped tokens (WBTC), and institutional adoption via ETFs.

## BTC Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, mining rewards, and as a store of value or investment asset.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~19.8 million BTC, with a max supply of 21 million.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Bitcoin; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/). Add to wallets like Electrum or hardware devices (e.g., Ledger).

# Who Are the Founders of Bitcoin?

Bitcoin was created by **Satoshi Nakamoto**, an anonymous individual or group, via a 2008 whitepaper. Nakamoto mined the genesis block in 2009 and disappeared in 2011, leaving development to a global community. The Bitcoin Core team and contributors maintain the protocol, with no central authority.

# What Makes Bitcoin Unique?

Bitcoin stands out as the original cryptocurrency:

- **Store of Value**: Often called “digital gold” due to its scarcity and inflation resistance.
- **Decentralization**: No central authority, with over 15,000 nodes ensuring resilience.
- **Institutional Adoption**: Held by MicroStrategy (252,220 BTC), spot BTC ETFs ($1.9B weekly inflows), and nations like El Salvador as legal tender.
- **Security**: Secured by the SHA-256 algorithm and the largest mining network, with a hash rate of ~700 EH/s.

# BTC Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Taproot Expansion (Q1 2025)**: Enhanced privacy and smart contract capabilities, boosting DeFi on sidechains.
- **Lightning Network Growth (March 2025)**: Processed 10M+ transactions monthly, enabling sub-second payments at ~$0.01 fees.
- **Firedancer Integration (June 2025)**: Improved node efficiency, supporting Bitcoin’s interoperability with Solana-based BTCfi.

# How Is BTC Secured?

Bitcoin and BTC are secured through:

- **PoW Consensus**: Miners use computational power to solve puzzles, with rewards of ~3.125 BTC per block post-2024 halving.
- **Decentralized Nodes**: Over 15,000 nodes validate transactions, preventing single points of failure.
- **SHA-256 Algorithm**: Cryptographic security protects against tampering and double-spending.
- **Hardware Wallets**: Devices like Trezor and Ledger secure private keys offline, mitigating malware risks.

# Conclusion

**Bitcoin (BTC)** is the pioneering cryptocurrency, powering a secure, decentralized blockchain that redefined digital finance. With its finite supply, institutional adoption, and upgrades like Taproot and Lightning Network, Bitcoin remains the dominant store of value in the $3.5T crypto market. Its resilience and global impact cement its role as a foundation for Web3 and beyond.
