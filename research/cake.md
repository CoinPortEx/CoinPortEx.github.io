# What Is PancakeSwap (CAKE)?

**PancakeSwap (CAKE)**, launched in September 2020, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) on the BNB Chain, offering low-cost, high-speed token swaps, liquidity provision, and DeFi services. Built to rival Ethereum-based DEXs like Uniswap, [Pancakeswap](https://pancakeswap.finance/?ref=coingecko&user=Coingecko&discount=0&perps=false) supports yield farming, NFTs, and lotteries. Its native token, **CAKE**, drives governance and incentives. 

## Key Features
- **Low-Cost AMM**: Processes swaps with ~$0.01 fees and 5-second finality, leveraging BNB Chain’s scalability (2,000 TPS).
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates on BNB Chain, Ethereum, Aptos, and Base, with ~$10B in lifetime trading volume.
- **Yield Farming and Staking**: Offers CAKE pools with up to 100% APY and syrup pools for partner tokens.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 150+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, HTX) and 200+ markets, with wallet support like Trust Wallet and MetaMask.

## CAKE Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, yield farming, and accessing lotteries and IFOs (Initial Farm Offerings).
- **Supply**: ~320M CAKE in circulation, with no fixed maximum supply due to inflationary emissions.
- **Contract Address**: On BNB Chain, CAKE’s contract is `0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pancakeswap) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pancakeswap/).

## Who Are the Founders of CAKE?

PancakeSwap was launched by an anonymous team, with no named founders, emphasizing community-driven development. Built on BNB Chain, it received early support from Binance Labs but operates as a decentralized protocol governed by CAKE holders via a DAO. No formal ICO was held, with tokens distributed through farming.

## What Makes CAKE Unique?

PancakeSwap stands out in Web3:
- **Low Fees**: BNB Chain’s low gas costs make swaps and farming 90% cheaper than Ethereum-based DEXs.
- **Diverse Offerings**: Combines AMM swaps, lotteries, NFT marketplaces, and IFOs for new token launches.
- **veCAKE Model**: Staked CAKE (veCAKE) grants voting power and up to 2x boosted farm rewards.


## CAKE Network Upgrades (2025)
- **V4 Launch (Q1 2025)**: Introduced concentrated liquidity and dynamic fees, boosting capital efficiency by 15%.
- **Aptos Expansion (March 2025)**: Added Aptos chain support, increasing trading volume by 10%.
- **AI Yield Optimizer (June 2025)**: Enhanced farming with AI-driven strategy selection, improving APYs by 12%.

## How Is CAKE Secured?

PancakeSwap and CAKE are secured through:
- **BNB Chain PoS**: Leverages BNB Chain’s Delegated Proof-of-Stake for transaction security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by CertiK and PeckShield ensure protocol integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: CAKE holders vote on upgrades, preventing centralized control.
- **Liquidity Pool Security**: Non-custodial pools and immutable contracts reduce hack risks, though a 2021 exploit highlighted vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

**PancakeSwap (CAKE)** is a leading DEX on BNB Chain, offering low-cost swaps and DeFi services with 300M circulating supply. Listed on 150+ exchanges, its veCAKE model, multi-chain support, and 2025 upgrades like V4 position it as a DeFi powerhouse. Despite inflationary tokenomics and past security concerns, PancakeSwap’s high yields and community governance make it a key player in Web3.
