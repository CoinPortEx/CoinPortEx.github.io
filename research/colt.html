<h1>Collateral Network (COLT)</h1>
<h2>What Is Collateral Network (COLT)?</h2>
<p>Collateral Network is a next-generation crowd-lending platform that allows people from around the world to borrow against real-world assets using blockchain technology. Our proprietary lending platform will provide borrowers with quick access to loans on the blockchain at competitive rates. This is achieved by minting NFTs that are backed by the borrowerâ€™s physical assets, enabling our community to become fractional lenders.</p>
<p>Features : Collateral makes it easy for you to get the most from your assets while holding your own keys. Realize the full potential of your assets through our bespoke earning and borrowing solutions.</p>
<p>SECURE : Collateral Network takes the first legal charge over the asset.</p>
<p>TRANSPARENT : No borrowing against future income, only against collateral you already own.</p>
<p>PRIVATE : No credit footprint. Ever. A private and confidential transaction.</p>
<p>FEES : Low, affordable fees that are agreed upon upfront on-chain.</p>
