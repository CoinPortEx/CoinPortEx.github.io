# What Is Compound (COMP)?

**Compound (COMP)**, launched in September 2018, is the governance token of the **Compound protocol**, a decentralized lending and borrowing platform on the **Ethereum blockchain**. Founded by Compound Labs, it enables users to lend or borrow 20+ cryptocurrencies, algorithmically setting interest rates based on supply and demand. [COMP](https://compound.finance/) empowers governance, staking, and yield farming, with $3B in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Lending**: Users deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against collateral, with rates adjusting dynamically.
- **cTokens**: Depositors receive cTokens (e.g., cETH, cUSDC) that accrue interest, redeemable anytime.
- **Cross-Chain Support**: Operates on Ethereum, with integrations on Arbitrum, Polygon, and Base.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports DeFi projects like Curve and Aave, with 130+ exchanges and $37.9M daily volume.

## COMP Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance voting, staking rewards, and incentivizing liquidity provision.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~9.1 million COMP, with a max supply of 10 million.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, COMP’s contract is `0xc00e94cb662c3520282e6f5717214004a7f26888` (addable to MetaMask).  [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/compound) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/compound/).

# Who Are the Founders of Compound?

Compound was founded in 2017 by **Robert Leshner** (CEO) and **Geoffrey Hayes** (CTO), both former Postmates executives. Backed by a $25M Series A from Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Polychain Capital, Compound Labs launched the protocol in 2018 and COMP in 2020, kickstarting the yield farming boom. The CompoundDAO governs upgrades.

# What Makes Compound Unique?

Compound pioneered DeFi lending:

- **Algorithmic Rates**: Interest rates adjust automatically based on market dynamics, no intermediaries needed.
- **cToken Model**: Depositors earn interest via cTokens, which increase in value over time.
- **Liquidation Safety**: Overcollateralized loans (50-75% LTV) are liquidated at a 5% discount if undercollateralized, protecting lenders.
- **Governance Incentives**: COMP distribution in 2020 boosted TVL to $800M, shaping DeFi’s growth.

# COMP Network Upgrades (2025)

- **API3 Oracle Integration (Q2 2025)**: Adopted API3’s OEV oracles on Mantle, enhancing price accuracy for $3B TVL.
- **Boomerang Incentives (March 2025)**: Introduced decentralized rewards, increasing lending activity by 15%.
- **Arbitrum Expansion (June 2025)**: Reduced gas fees by 20% for cToken transactions, boosting adoption.

# How Is COMP Secured?

Compound and COMP are secured through:

- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and smart contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure protocol integrity.
- **Collateralization**: Enforces overcollateralization, with liquidations protecting pool stability.
- **CompoundDAO**: COMP holders vote on upgrades, ensuring decentralized governance.

# Conclusion

**Compound (COMP)** is a cornerstone of DeFi, offering decentralized lending and borrowing with dynamic rates and cToken innovation. With $3B TVL, multichain support, and upgrades like API3 oracles, it drives Web3 adoption.
