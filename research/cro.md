# What Is Cronos (CRO)?

**Cronos (CRO)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Cronos blockchain, an institutional-grade, EVM-compatible Layer-1 network built on the Cosmos SDK and integrated with the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol. Launched in 2018 as Crypto.com Coin and rebranded in 2021, Cronos powers DeFi, GameFi, NFTs, and tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) with high scalability, supporting up to 60,000 TPS, 500ms block times, instant finality, and sub-$0.01 fees. Backed by Crypto.com's 150M+ user base, it bridges traditional finance and Web3 through compliant, AI-accessible infrastructure.
## Key Features
- **High-Performance Layer-1**: EVM-compatible for easy Ethereum dApp portability, with Cosmos SDK and IBC for cross-chain interoperability.
- **Scalability and Efficiency**: Processes 60,000 TPS with 500ms blocks, instant finality, and low fees, handling over 150M transactions for 1.8M users.
- **DeFi and Tokenization**: Supports lending, liquidity provision, RWAs (e.g., equities, real estate), and AI-native SDK for on-chain AI agents.
- **Dual-Chain Architecture**: Cronos Chain (EVM) for smart contracts and Crypto.org Chain (Tendermint PoS) for payments, enabling seamless DeFi and transactions.
- **Ecosystem Support**: $100M Cronos Labs fund incubates dApps, with tools like The Graph for data indexing and zkEVM for zero-knowledge scalability.

## CRO Token
- **Purpose**: Pays transaction fees (gas), enables staking for yields and governance, serves as collateral in DeFi, provides liquidity in pools, and unlocks rewards on Crypto.com (e.g., Visa cards, ETFs). Also funds AI development and voting in the ecosystem.
- **Supply**: ~33.62B CRO in circulation, with a total supply of ~98B and maximum of 100B (includes quarterly burns via dynamic formula to reduce supply).
- **Contract Address**: Native to Cronos blockchain; compatible with wallets like Crypto.com DeFi Wallet, Keplr, or MetaMask for EVM interactions [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cronos) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/cronos/).

## Who Are the Founders of Cronos?

## How Is Cronos Secured?
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus**: Energy-efficient validators secure the network via staking, with Tendermint for fast finality and IBC for secure cross-chain transfers.
- **zkEVM and Circuit Breakers**: Zero-knowledge proofs enhance privacy/scalability; emergency halts prevent exploits, with zero downtime over 4 years.
- **Audits and Compliance**: Regular smart contract audits, KYC/AML via Crypto.com's regulatory framework, and permissioned validators reduce centralization risks.
- **Network Protections**: Low fees deter spam; audited bridges and The Graph ensure data integrity, supporting $500M+ TVL without major incidents.

## Conclusion
**Cronos (CRO)** is a scalable Layer-1 blockchain powering DeFi, RWAs, and AI innovation, backed by Crypto.com's global reach. 2025 upgrades like POS v6, zkEVM, and the Trump Media partnership position it for institutional adoption and explosive growth. With token burns, ETFs, and a vision for tokenized "everything" in Web3, CRO emerges as a cornerstone of compliant, high-performance finance.
