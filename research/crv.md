# What Is Curve DAO (CRV)?

**Curve DAO (CRV)**, launched in August 2020, is a decentralized autonomous organization governing Curve Finance, a leading DeFi protocol on Ethereum optimized for stablecoin and low-slippage token swaps. Using an automated market maker (AMM) model, [Curve](https://www.curve.finance/dex/) facilitates efficient liquidity pools. Its native token, **CRV**, drives governance and incentivizes liquidity providers. 

## Key Features
- **Stablecoin Focus**: Offers low-fee, low-slippage swaps for stablecoins (e.g., USDC, DAI) and pegged assets like WBTC, with ~$34.6B in Q1 2025 trading volume.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates on Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom, and Base, enhancing scalability.
- **crvUSD Stablecoin**: A decentralized stablecoin with yield, borrowable against assets like ETH via Curve Lend’s LLAMMA engine.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 260+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and 300+ markets, with wallet support like MetaMask.

## CRV Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, voting, and boosting liquidity rewards up to 2.5x via veCRV (vote-escrowed CRV).
- **Supply**: ~1.4B CRV in circulation, with a maximum supply of 3.03B.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, CRV’s contract is `0xd533a949740bb3306d119cc777fa900ba034cd52` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/curve-dao-token) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/curve-dao-token/).

## Who Are the Founders of CRV?

Curve Finance was founded by **Michael Egorov**, a Russian scientist and former CTO of NuCypher. Launched in January 2020, the Curve DAO and CRV token followed in August, using Aragon for governance. The project has raised $182.4M, though distribution details are unclear. It’s now community-governed by veCRV holders.

## What Makes CRV Unique?

Curve DAO stands out in Web3:
- **Low-Slippage AMM**: Optimized pricing formula minimizes slippage for stablecoin swaps, unlike general-purpose DEXs.
- **veCRV Model**: Staking CRV for veCRV grants voting power and 50% of trading fees, distributing ~$130M to stakers since 2020.
- **DeFi Integrations**: Powers protocols like Convex Finance and Yearn, with 62% of CRV supply allocated to liquidity providers.


## CRV Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Binance Alpha Listing (June 2025)**: Enabled CRV trading with a 240M token airdrop, boosting liquidity.
- **Curve Lend V2 (March 2025)**: Enhanced crvUSD borrowing markets, increasing TVL by 10%.
- **Gauge Weight Voting (Q2 2025)**: Improved weekly veCRV voting for pool rewards, optimizing yield farming efficiency.

## How Is CRV Secured?

Curve DAO and CRV are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure protocol integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: veCRV holders vote on upgrades, preventing centralized control.
- **Liquidity Pool Security**: Non-custodial pools and immutable contracts reduce hack risks, though a 2023 exploit highlighted vulnerabilities.

## Conclusion

**Curve DAO (CRV)** is a cornerstone of DeFi, optimizing stablecoin swaps with a  1.4B circulating supply. Listed on 260+ exchanges, its veCRV model, crvUSD stablecoin, and 2025 upgrades like Binance Alpha solidify its dominance. Despite past security concerns, Curve’s low-slippage AMM and community governance make it a vital Web3 protocol, though competition from newer DEXs remains a challenge.
