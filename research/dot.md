# What Is Polkadot (DOT)?

**Polkadot (DOT)**, launched in May 2020, is the native cryptocurrency of the **Polkadot protocol**, a Layer-0 blockchain designed to connect and secure multiple blockchains, enabling interoperability. Founded by the Web3 Foundation, [Polkadot](https://polkadot.com/) uses a sharded multichain architecture with a Relay Chain and parachains, facilitating cross-chain data and asset transfers. DOT powers governance, staking, parachain bonding, and coretime purchases, with $4.8B in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Interoperability**: Relay Chain enables trustless communication between 50+ parachains like Astar and Kusama.
- **High Scalability**: Processes up to 143,000 transactions per second (TPS) via parallel parachain execution.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.05, ideal for DeFi and dApps.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports 1,500+ projects, including Moonbeam and Centrifuge, with $162M daily trading volume.

## DOT Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, parachain auctions, coretime purchases, and network fees.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~1.5 billion DOT, with no max supply (inflationary model).
- **Contract Address**: Native to Polkadot; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polkadot) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polkadot-new/). Add to wallets like Polkadot.js or Talisman.

# Who Are the Founders of Polkadot?

Polkadot was founded by **Dr. Gavin Wood**, Ethereum co-founder and Solidity creator, alongside **Robert Habermeier**, a Thiel Fellow, and **Peter Czaban**, former Web3 Foundation Technology Director. Launched via a $145M ICO in 2017, the Web3 Foundation and Parity Technologies drive development, with Wood coining “Web3.”

# What Makes Polkadot Unique?

Polkadot’s architecture redefines blockchain connectivity:

- **Relay Chain & Parachains**: Central Relay Chain secures and connects parachains, which specialize in DeFi, NFTs, or bridges.
- **Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)**: Validators and nominators stake DOT for security and rewards, with 1,200+ validators.
- **Polkadot 2.0**: Agile Coretime replaces slot auctions, enabling on-demand blockspace purchases, reducing developer barriers.
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Enables privacy-focused KYC and cross-platform identity, powered by Polkadot SDK.

# DOT Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Polkadot 2.0 Launch (Q1 2025)**: Introduced Agile Coretime, boosting scalability and lowering parachain costs by 30%.
- **OpenGov Enhancement (March 2025)**: Streamlined referendum voting, increasing DAO participation to 1.48M DOT holders.
- **Substrate SDK Update (June 2025)**: Added no-code deployment tools, onboarding 200+ new dApps.

# How Is DOT Secured?

Polkadot and DOT are secured through:

- **NPoS Consensus**: Validators stake DOT, backed by nominators, with slashing for misbehaviour.
- **Relay Chain Security**: Pools security across parachains, with 1,200+ nodes ensuring resilience.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Parachains like Moonbeam audited by firms like CertiK.
- **PolkadotDAO**: 1.48M DOT holders vote on upgrades via OpenGov, ensuring decentralization.

# Conclusion

**Polkadot (DOT)** is a Layer-0 protocol uniting blockchains with unparalleled interoperability and scalability. With $4.8B TVL, 143,000 TPS, and Polkadot 2.0’s Agile Coretime, it empowers Web3 innovation.
