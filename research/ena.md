# What Is Ethena (ENA)?

**Ethena (ENA)**, launched in April 2024, is the governance token of the [Ethena](https://ethena.fi/) synthetic dollar protocol, a decentralized platform on Ethereum that provides a crypto-native stablecoin, USDe, and a savings instrument, the “Internet Bond.” Ethena aims to offer a stable, censorship-resistant alternative to traditional banking infrastructure. ENA powers governance, staking, and protocol incentives, supporting USDe’s $6 billion circulation and integrations with platforms like Spark and BlackRock’s BUIDL fund. The ecosystem ranks #3 among stablecoin protocols by market cap.

## Key Features
- **Synthetic Stablecoin**: USDe, a USD-pegged stablecoin, uses delta-hedging with staked Ethereum collateral for stability.
- **Internet Bond**: Offers a dollar-denominated savings instrument with DeFi yields, accessible globally.
- **Multichain Presence**: Deployed on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism, with bridges to Solana and others.
- **Governance**: ENA holders vote on protocol upgrades, risk parameters, and integrations.

# Who Are the Founders of Ethena?

Ethena was developed by **Ethena Labs**, founded by **Guy Young**, a former Wall Street quant with experience at firms like Cerberus Capital.

- **Converge Blockchain**: A partnership with Securitize targets RWA tokenization for institutional capital onboarding.
