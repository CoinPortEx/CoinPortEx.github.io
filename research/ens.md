# What Is Ethereum Name Service (ENS)?

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)**, launched on May 4, 2017, is a decentralized naming system on the **Ethereum blockchain**, with its native governance token **ENS** introduced in November 2021. Developed by the ENS Foundation, ENS maps human-readable names (e.g., `yourname.eth`) to machine-readable identifiers like wallet addresses, simplifying Web3 interactions. [ENS](https://ens.domains/) powers identity, payments, and dApp integrations, with $1.2B in total value locked (TVL) across its ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Human-Readable Names**: Replaces complex addresses (e.g., `0x123...`) with names like `bob.eth`, reducing errors.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Supports 2.6M+ registered `.eth` names, used across 800+ dApps like Uniswap and OpenSea.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.10-$1 on Ethereum, with Layer-2 support (e.g., Arbitrum) reducing costs.
- **Ecosystem**: Integrates with 126+ exchanges, wallets like MetaMask, and platforms like Coinbase Wallet.

## ENS Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance voting, name registration fees, and incentivizing ENS node operators.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~33 million ENS, with a max supply of 100 million.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, ENS’s contract is `0xc18360217d8f7ab5e7c516566761ea12ce7f9d72` (addable to MetaMask). [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum-name-service) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum-name-service/).

# Who Are the Founders of ENS?

ENS was founded by **Nick Johnson** and **Alex Van de Sande**, under the Ethereum Foundation until 2018. The **ENS Foundation**, led by **Brantly Millegan** until 2022, now oversees development, with the ENS DAO governing via ENS token holders. Launched with a $10M grant, ENS raised $65M in 2022 from True Ventures and a16z.

# What Makes ENS Unique?

ENS redefines Web3 identity:

- **Decentralized DNS**: Unlike ICANN-governed DNS, ENS uses smart contracts and DAO governance, ensuring censorship resistance.
- **Primary Name System**: Users set a primary `.eth` name for wallets and dApps to display, enhancing UX across Uniswap and Etherscan.
- **Cross-Platform Utility**: Supports avatars, content hashes, and metadata, with 40+ integrations like Farcaster.
- **Layer-2 Scaling**: Gasless DNSSEC on Arbitrum and Optimism lowers costs, boosting adoption.

# ENS Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Gasless DNSSEC (Q1 2025)**: Enabled off-chain name resolution on Arbitrum, reducing fees by 80%.
- **Farcaster Integration (March 2025)**: Added ENS usernames to Farcaster, increasing social media adoption.
- **Stablecoin Payments (June 2025)**: Allowed merchants to accept ENS-based stablecoin payments globally.

# How Is ENS Secured?

ENS and its token are secured through:

- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and smart contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure protocol integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: 33M ENS token holders vote on upgrades, ensuring decentralized control.
- **Name Ownership**: `.eth` names are owned by smart contracts, preventing centralized seizures.

# Conclusion

**Ethereum Name Service (ENS)** is a cornerstone of Web3, simplifying addresses with `.eth` names and driving decentralized identity. With $1.2B TVL, 2.6M+ names, and integrations like Farcaster, ENS enhances usability across 800+ dApps.
