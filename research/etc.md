# What Is Ethereum Classic (ETC)?

**Ethereum Classic (ETC)** is a decentralized, open-source blockchain platform that runs smart contracts, launched in July 2015 as the original Ethereum blockchain. Following a hard fork in July 2016 due to the DAO hack, [ETC](https://ethereumclassic.org/) emerged as the chain preserving Ethereum’s initial vision of immutability, where "code is law." Its native token, **ETC**, powers transactions and smart contract execution. 

## Key Features
- **Immutable Blockchain**: Maintains an unalterable ledger, rejecting rollbacks even after hacks, prioritizing decentralization.
- **Smart Contracts**: Supports Ethereum’s EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), enabling dApps for DeFi, NFTs, and more.
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Secured by ~300 TH/s hashrate, with miners earning ~2.56 ETC per block (reducing to 2.048 ETC in June 2024).
- **Ecosystem**: Integrated with 273+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and wallets like MetaMask.

## ETC Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees (gas), smart contract execution, and mining rewards.
- **Supply**: ~150M ETC in circulation, with a maximum supply of 210.7M (unlike ETH’s uncapped supply).
- **Contract Address**: Native to its own blockchain

## Who Are the Founders of ETC?

ETC shares Ethereum’s origins, founded by **Vitalik Buterin**, **Gavin Wood**, **Anthony Di Iorio**, and **Charles Hoskinson** in 2015. After the 2016 DAO hack (3.6M ETH stolen), the community split. ETC continued as the original chain, supported by developers and miners valuing immutability. It operates as a "do-ocracy" with no centralized governance, driven by a global developer community.

## What Makes ETC Unique?

ETC distinguishes itself in Web3:
- **Immutability Commitment**: Unlike Ethereum (ETH), which forked to reverse the DAO hack, ETC upholds "code is law."
- **PoW Security**: The largest PoW smart contract platform, avoiding Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake shift.
- **Sound Money**: Capped at 210.7M ETC, resembling "digital gold" with predictable issuance.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Retains Ethereum’s original EVM, supporting early dApps, though scalability lags.

## ETC Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Spiral Upgrade (Q2 2025)**: Improved EVM performance and reduced block times to ~12 seconds for better throughput 
- **MESS Implementation (April 2025)**: Enabled Merged Mining to enhance security by allowing dual mining with other PoW chains.
- **Layer-2 Exploration (June 2025)**: Launched testnets for rollups to improve scalability and lower gas fees.

## How Is ETC Secured?

ETC’s security includes:
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Uses Ethash algorithm with ~300 TH/s hashrate, though past 51% attacks (e.g., August 2020) highlight risks.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Community-driven audits ensure contract integrity.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community proposals and miner adoption drive upgrades.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Permanent transactions and contracts enhance transparency.

## Conclusion

**Ethereum Classic (ETC)** upholds blockchain purism, preserving Ethereum’s original immutable vision. With a robust PoW security, ETC supports smart contracts and dApps. Its "code is law" ethos and emerging Layer-2 solutions make it a unique Web3 platform for those prioritizing decentralization and unalterable principles.
