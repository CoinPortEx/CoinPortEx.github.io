# Ethereum (ETH)

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source **blockchain platform** that enables the creation and execution of **smart contracts** and **decentralized applications (dApps)**. Unlike Bitcoin, which primarily serves as a digital currency, Ethereum is a programmable blockchain, allowing developers to build applications for finance, gaming, supply chain, and more. **Ether (ETH)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, used to pay for transaction fees and computational services. Ethereum was proposed in 2013 by Vitalik Buterin and launched in 2015.

Ethereum operates without a central authority, with transactions and smart contracts verified by a global network of nodes through cryptography and recorded on a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. It has been praised for its flexibility and innovation but criticized for **high transaction fees (gas fees)** during network congestion, **energy consumption** in its earlier proof-of-work phase, and **security vulnerabilities** in some smart contracts.

## Key Features and Technology

Ethereum's blockchain supports smart contracts—self-executing agreements with code that automatically enforces terms. This enables dApps, which power **decentralized finance (DeFi)**, **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)**, and other applications. Ethereum initially used a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, similar to Bitcoin, but transitioned to **proof-of-stake (PoS)** with the **Ethereum 2.0 upgrade** (completed in September 2022, known as "The Merge"). This shift reduced energy consumption by approximately 99.95%, addressing environmental concerns.

Ether (ETH) is created through mining (pre-Merge) and staking (post-Merge). Unlike Bitcoin's fixed supply, Ethereum has no hard cap, though issuance is limited, and mechanisms like **EIP-1559** (introduced in 2021) burn a portion of transaction fees, potentially making ETH deflationary under high network usage.

Ethereum has faced challenges, including **scalability issues**, leading to high gas fees during peak times. Solutions like **layer-2 scaling** (e.g., Optimism, Arbitrum) and **sharding** (planned for future upgrades) aim to improve transaction throughput and affordability. Regulatory scrutiny has also increased, with some agencies questioning whether certain Ethereum-based tokens or activities constitute securities.

## Units and Divisibility

The unit of account for the Ethereum system is Ether (ETH). Its currency codes are ETH and occasionally XETH. The Unicode character for Ether is Ξ. One Ether is divisible to 18 decimal places, allowing for precise transactions. Smaller units include:

-   **Gwei**: 1/1,000,000,000 ETH (1 billionth), commonly used to measure gas fees.
-   **Wei**: The smallest unit, 1/1,000,000,000,000,000,000 ETH (1 quintillionth), named after Wei Dai, a cryptography pioneer.

For example, 1,000,000,000 Gwei equals 1 ETH, and 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei equals 1 ETH.

## Ownership

In the Ethereum blockchain, Ether and other tokens are held in **Ethereum addresses**, which are generated from a **private key** using cryptographic algorithms. Creating an address involves selecting a random private key and deriving the corresponding **public address**. This process is fast, but reversing it—computing the private key from a public address—is computationally infeasible, ensuring security.

To spend Ether or interact with smart contracts, the owner must use the private key to sign transactions. The network verifies these signatures using the public key, keeping the private key confidential. If a private key is lost, the associated Ether becomes inaccessible, effectively lost. If a private key is compromised (e.g., via phishing or hacks), the funds can be stolen. High-profile incidents, such as the **2016 DAO hack** (where $50 million in ETH was stolen) and various exchange breaches, highlight these risks. As of 2023, estimates suggest millions of dollars in ETH and tokens have been lost or stolen due to such incidents.

Ownership distribution is uneven. As of early 2023, a small percentage of Ethereum addresses (less than 1%) hold a significant portion of ETH, with large holders (**"whales"**) and institutional investors controlling substantial amounts. Staking pools and exchanges also concentrate ETH holdings.

## Adoption and Use Cases

Ethereum is the backbone of DeFi, hosting protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound, which manage billions in assets. It powers the NFT ecosystem, with platforms like OpenSea facilitating digital art and collectible trading. Ethereum is also used for tokenized assets, gaming (e.g., Axie Infinity), and enterprise solutions (e.g., supply chain tracking).

Some governments and institutions have explored Ethereum for blockchain-based projects, though no country has adopted ETH as legal tender. El Salvador, for instance, focuses on Bitcoin but has shown interest in Ethereum-based solutions. Regulatory bodies, particularly in the U.S., have debated Ethereum's status, with the SEC suggesting in some contexts that ETH may not be a security, though clarity remains elusive.
