# What Is Ethereum (ETH)?

**Ethereum (ETH)**, launched in July 2015, is the native cryptocurrency of the **Ethereum blockchain**, a decentralized, open-source Layer 1 blockchain that pioneered smart contracts. Founded by Vitalik Buterin and others, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) enables developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) for DeFi, NFTs, gaming, and more. ETH powers transaction fees (gas), staking, and governance within the ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Programmable contracts automate trustless transactions, supporting 350K+ dApps.
- **High Adoption**: Hosts ~60% of DeFi’s $220B total value locked (TVL) and major Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum and Polygon.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Energy-efficient consensus post-Merge (2022), with 33M+ ETH staked.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports tokens like USDT, UNI, and ENS, with 17.4M active addresses weekly.

## ETH Token
- **Purpose**: Used for gas fees, staking, and as a store of value or collateral in DeFi.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~120.7 million ETH, with no fixed max supply (deflationary since EIP-1559).
- **Contract Address**: Native to Ethereum; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ethereum/). Add to wallets like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.

# Who Are the Founders of Ethereum?

Ethereum was co-founded by **Vitalik Buterin**, **Gavin Wood**, **Anthony Di Iorio**, **Charles Hoskinson**, and others in 2013. The Ethereum Foundation, based in Switzerland, oversees development. Funded by a 2014 ICO raising $18.3M, Ethereum launched with an ROI of ~270% annually. Buterin remains a key figure, guiding protocol upgrades.

# What Makes Ethereum Unique?

Ethereum stands out for its smart contract platform:

- **Developer Ecosystem**: Largest dApp ecosystem, with tools like Solidity and Ethers.js attracting 1M+ developers.
- **Layer 2 Scaling**: Solutions like Optimism and Base reduce gas fees (~$0.01-$0.10) and boost TPS to 100K+.
- **Institutional Support**: Backed by BlackRock, Fidelity, and spot ETH ETFs, with $1.9B in weekly inflows.
- **Deflationary Mechanism**: EIP-1559 burns ~3M ETH annually, reducing supply during high network activity.

# ETH Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Pectra Hard Fork (June 2025)**: Enhanced EVM efficiency and validator stability, boosting TPS by 20%.
- **Sharding Progress (Q2 2025)**: Split database into 64 shard chains, lowering node requirements and gas fees.
- **Layer 2 Growth (May 2025)**: Arbitrum and Base hit 7.55x adoption, processing 80% of Ethereum’s transactions.

# How Is ETH Secured?

Ethereum and ETH are secured through:

- **PoS Consensus**: Validators stake ETH (minimum 32 ETH) to secure the network, with slashing for misbehavior.
- **Validator Network**: Over 1M validators globally, ensuring decentralization.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like ConsenSys and Trail of Bits mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Governance**: ETH holders and developers vote on upgrades via EIPs, fostering community-driven security.

# Conclusion

**Ethereum (ETH)** powers the world’s leading smart contract blockchain, driving innovation in DeFi, NFTs, and Web3. With its robust developer ecosystem, Layer 2 scaling, and institutional adoption via ETFs, Ethereum remains a cornerstone of the $3.5T crypto market. Recent upgrades like Pectra and sharding position it for scalability and global impact.
