# What Is Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET)?

**Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET)**, rebranded in July 2024, is the governance token of the [Artificial Superintelligence Alliance](https://superintelligence.io/), a decentralized AI consortium formed by merging Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS. Built on Ethereum, the alliance aims to advance Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through an open-source, decentralized network of AI agents, data markets, and computing resources. FET powers governance, staking, and access to AI services, with a $1.6 billion market cap in the AI crypto sector.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized AI**: Connects AI agents for tasks like portfolio management, data analysis, and pathfinding across Fetch.ai’s agentverse.
- **Token Merger**: Consolidated FET, AGIX, OCEAN, and CUDOS into FET, creating a unified AI token ($ASI) for ecosystem interoperability.
- **Multichain Support**: Operates on Ethereum, with bridges to Cosmos and other chains for cross-chain AI services.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes AI agent launchpads, Ocean’s data markets, and CUDOS’s computing power, with $200M TVL.

## FET Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, transaction fees, and accessing AI services.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~2.6 billion FET, with a max supply of 2.7 billion.
- **Contract Address**: `0xaea46a60368a7bd060eec7df8cba43b7ef41ad85` (Ethereum, addable to MetaMask),

# Who Are the Founders of Artificial Superintelligence Alliance?

The alliance was formed by merging **Fetch.ai** (founded by Humayun Sheikh), **SingularityNET** (founded by Ben Goertzel), **Ocean Protocol** (founded by Bruce Pon), and **CUDOS** (founded by Matt Hawkins). These leaders, with expertise in AI, blockchain, and distributed systems, united in 2024 to create a decentralized AGI ecosystem, countering centralized AI dominance by Big Tech.

# What Makes Artificial Superintelligence Alliance Unique?

FET and the alliance stand out for their AI consortium model:

- **Unified AI Ecosystem**: Combines Fetch.ai’s AI agents, Ocean’s data markets, SingularityNET’s AI services, and CUDOS’s computing for a vertically integrated AGI platform.
- **Token Migration**: FET replaced AGIX and OCEAN via a 2024 merger, with migration dApps enabling seamless token swaps.
- **AI Agentverse**: Fetch.ai’s agentverse supports autonomous AI agents for finance, health, and legal tasks, with domain-specific expertise.
- **Community Governance**: FET holders govern protocol upgrades, ensuring decentralized control over AGI development.

The alliance’s $26.4 billion AI crypto market share and bullish community sentiment highlight its DeAI leadership.

# FET Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Migration dApps (Q2 2025)**: Tools for AGIX and OCEAN to FET conversion went live, with CEX support for $ASI
- **CoinGecko Page Update**: Improved website, documentation, and Telegram URLs, enhancing accessibility.
- **Converge Blockchain**: Partnered with Securitize to tokenize real-world assets (RWAs) for AI infrastructure funding.



# How Is FET Secured?

FET and the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance are secured through:

- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s proof-of-stake for primary security.
- **Governance**: FET holders vote on protocol upgrades and risk parameters.
- **CUDOS Computing**: Decentralized cloud resources enhance network resilience.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits mitigate vulnerabilities across agentverse and data markets.



# Conclusion

**Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (FET)** powers a decentralized AI consortium, uniting Fetch.ai, SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS to advance AGI. Its unified token, AI agentverse, and community governance make it a DeAI leader.
