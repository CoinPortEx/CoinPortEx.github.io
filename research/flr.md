# What Is Flare (FLR)?

**Flare (FLR)**, launched in July 2022, is the native token of the [Flare Network](https://flare.network/), an EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain designed for decentralized data interoperability. Flare enables developers to build dApps with access to high-integrity data from other blockchains and the internet, supporting use cases like DeFi, RWAs, and social networks. FLR powers transaction fees, staking, and governance.

## Key Features
- **Data Interoperability**: State Connector and Flare Time Series Oracle (FTSO) provide decentralized blockchain and Web2 data for dApps.
- **FAssets System**: Enables non-smart contract tokens (e.g., XRP, DOGE) to be used in Flare’s smart contracts.
- **LayerCake**: Facilitates cross-chain bridging for seamless asset transfers.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes DeFi (Flare Finance), staking (FLRETH, $3M TVL), and partnerships with VivoPower ($100M XRP deployment).

## FLR Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and delegating to FTSO data providers.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~68 billion FLR, with a max supply of 100 billion.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Flare Network,

# Who Are the Founders of Flare?

Flare was founded by **Hugo Philion**, **Sean Rowan**, and **Dr. Nairi Usher**, who met at University College London studying machine learning. With $250M+ raised from investors like DCG and Kenetic, the team launched Flare’s mainnet in July 2022, followed by a public token distribution in January 2023.

# What Makes Flare Unique?

FLR and Flare Network stand out for their data-centric design:

- **State Connector**: Acquires event data from blockchains and Web2 APIs, with independent attestation providers ensuring consensus.
- **FTSO**: Delivers decentralized price feeds for dApps, reducing reliance on centralized oracles.
- **XRPFi Focus**: Integrates XRP for DeFi, with VivoPower deploying $100M in XRP for yield generation.
- **Wrapped FLR (WFLR)**: Enables delegation to FTSO providers and governance, with $1.17M in 24-hour trading volume.


# FLR Network Upgrades (2025)

- **BitGo Partnership (June 2025)**: Added FLR and SGB custody, enabling institutional staking.
- **EasyA Campaign (June 2025)**: Launched #60DaysOfFlare to onboard developers via hackathons.
- **VivoPower Deal (June 2025)**: Deployed $100M XRP for DeFi yield, boosting XRPFi adoption.



# How Is FLR Secured?

FLR and the Flare Network are secured through:

- **FBA Consensus**: Uses Avalanche protocol for scalable, decentralized security without economic penalties.
- **Staking**: FLR holders stake to validators, securing the network and FTSO data feeds.
- **Governance**: WFLR holders vote on protocol upgrades and policies.
- **Audits**: Regular smart contract audits ensure dApp and FAsset safety.

# Conclusion
