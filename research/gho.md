# What Is GHO?

**GHO** is a decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar, native to the Aave Protocol. Launched on Ethereum Mainnet in July 2023 (following governance approvals in 2022–2023), GHO enables users to mint the stablecoin by supplying collateral in Aave lending markets, allowing them to earn interest on supplied assets while borrowing GHO at protocol-defined rates. Issued and fully governed by the Aave DAO, it operates primarily on Ethereum (with expansions to chains like Arbitrum, Base, Gnosis, and Mantle via V3 integrations and Chainlink CCIP bridging) as an ERC-20 token. GHO combines DeFi lending efficiency with stable value, supporting payments, hedging, yield farming, collateral in other protocols, and more.

Unlike centralized stablecoins, repaid interest on GHO borrows flows directly to the Aave DAO treasury, enhancing protocol sustainability and reducing external dependencies.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized & Overcollateralized Stability** — Pegged to $1 USD through overcollateralization (average ~245% ratio) backed by diverse crypto assets in Aave markets.
- **Multi-Chain Support** — Native on Ethereum V3; bridged and live on Arbitrum, Base, Mantle (launched February 2026), and others via governance-approved facilitators.
- **Yield Opportunities** — Savings GHO (sGHO) provides a yield-bearing version (typically 5–10% APY variable in early 2026); future enhancements like stkGHO in Aave V4 expected to offer higher returns.
- **Flashmint Facilitator** — Allows flash-minting (similar to flash loans) for instant liquidity in single transactions.
- **Governance-Driven** — All parameters (borrow rates, supply caps, chain expansions, incentives) controlled via Aave DAO on-chain votes.
- **Ecosystem Integration** — Deep composability in Aave lending, DeFi protocols, payments, and real-world applications; minimal integration effort required.

## GHO Token
- **Purpose** — Protocol-native stable value for borrowing, lending, payments, yield generation, and DeFi collateral without centralized issuers.
- **Supply** — Circulating/Total supply approximately 527.4 million GHO (as of mid-February 2026); no fixed maximum supply (minted on demand via collateral).
- **Contract Address** (Ethereum Mainnet): `0x40D16FC0246aD3160Ccc09B8D0D3A2cD28aE6C2f` (addable to MetaMask).

## Who Are the Founders of GHO?

GHO was developed and launched by the **Aave Protocol** team and community. Aave, a leading DeFi lending platform, was founded by **Stani Kulechov** in 2017 (originally as ETHLend, rebranded to Aave). GHO emerged from Aave DAO proposals, votes, and implementation led by Aave Labs (with contributions from developers and governance participants), emphasizing decentralized control over the stablecoin's parameters and growth.

## What Makes GHO Unique?

GHO stands out in the stablecoin space due to its tight integration with Aave:

- **Native Protocol Stablecoin** — Recycles capital within Aave, directing borrow interest to the DAO treasury instead of external entities, improving retention and efficiency.
- **DAO Governance & Transparency** — Fully decentralized; risk parameters, rates, expansions, and incentives set via community votes; high collateralization ratios and on-chain transparency.
- **Yield-Bearing Variants** — sGHO delivers low-risk, instant-liquidity yield on stable holdings; upcoming V4 features may enhance this further.
- **Market Position** — One of the leading decentralized stablecoins by adoption within the Aave ecosystem; surpassed $500M supply milestone in early 2026 with consistent growth.
- **Capital Efficiency** — Users earn yield on collateral while borrowing GHO; supports flashminting, multi-chain bridging, and protocol-aligned incentives.

## GHO Updates (2026)

- **Supply & Adoption Growth** — Circulating supply reached ~527.4M GHO by mid-February 2026, with over 245% growth since early 2025; holder base and utility expanding steadily.
- **Integrations & Expansions** — Aave V3 launched on Mantle (February 2026) with a 1.5M GHO incentive program (backed by DAO and partners like Bybit/Mantle); sGHO yield active across chains like Arbitrum, Base, Gnosis; continued bridging via Chainlink CCIP.
- **Upcoming Roadmap** — Aave V4 (expected later in 2026) introduces unified liquidity hubs, modular risk controls, native GHO enhancements as internal credit tool, and potential stkGHO for higher yields; focus on GHO liquidity support, DEX/CEX optimizations, and regulatory integrations (e.g., EU MiCAR ramps).
- **Notable Events** — Emphasis on conservative risk management; DAO proposals for direct GHO liquidity provision, treasury runway support, and partnerships boosting institutional-grade access.

## How Is GHO Secured?

GHO security is built on:

- **Overcollateralization** — Backed by diverse assets (ETH, stablecoins, etc.) in Aave V3 pools at high ratios (~245% average); features e-mode, isolation mode, supply caps, and liquidations.
- **Blockchain Security** — Secured by Ethereum and supported chains' consensus mechanisms; audited smart contracts.
- **Governance & Transparency** — Aave DAO controls changes; fixed decentralized oracle maintains peg; real-time interest accrual redirected to treasury.
- **Stability Mechanisms** — Market-driven incentives, protocol liquidations, flashmint efficiency; no central reserves but fully protocol-backed.
- **Audits & Oversight** — Regular protocol audits; transparent on-chain data, governance votes, and risk oracle enhancements.

## Conclusion

**GHO** is Aave's flagship decentralized stablecoin, offering a fully on-chain, overcollateralized USD-pegged asset integrated deeply with one of DeFi's premier lending protocols. With reliable peg stability, yield via sGHO, multi-chain availability, and DAO governance, it provides capital-efficient borrowing, savings, and utility free from centralized control. In mid-February 2026, following its $500M+ milestone, Mantle expansion, and Aave V4 preparations, GHO solidifies its role as a core DeFi primitive for hedging, payments, liquidity, and ecosystem growth. As decentralized stablecoins and on-chain credit evolve, GHO delivers a transparent, compliant, protocol-aligned option.
