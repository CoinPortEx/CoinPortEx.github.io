# What Is The Graph (GRT)?

**The Graph (GRT)**, launched in December 2020, is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data, often called the "Google of Web3." Built on Ethereum, The [Graph](https://thegraph.com/) enables developers to build efficient dApps by accessing structured data via subgraphs. Its native token, **GRT**, incentivizes network participants. 

## Key Features
- **Subgraph Indexing**: Organizes blockchain data into queryable subgraphs, powering dApps like Uniswap and Aave.
- **Decentralized Network**: Over 40,000 subgraphs and 1,000+ indexers process ~1B queries monthly.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Indexes data from Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, and 40+ chains.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 200+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and 300+ markets, with wallet support like MetaMask.

## GRT Token
- **Purpose**: Used for staking, governance, paying indexers, and curator signaling.
- **Supply**: ~9.5B GRT in circulation, with a maximum supply of 10.79B.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, GRT’s contract is `0xc944e90c64b2c07662a292be6244bdf05cda44a7` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/the-graph) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/the-graph/).

## Who Are the Founders of GRT?

The Graph was co-founded by **Yaniv Tal** (CEO), **Jannis Pohlmann**, and **Brandon Ramirez** in 2018. Backed by The Graph Foundation, it raised $50M in funding from Multicoin Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and others. The project is governed by a decentralized council and GRT holders.

## What Makes GRT Unique?

The Graph stands out in Web3:
- **Web3 Data Layer**: Simplifies blockchain data access, enabling dApps to query complex data without centralized servers.
- **Incentive Model**: Indexers and curators stake GRT to earn query fees, ensuring data availability.
- **Broad Adoption**: Powers 70%+ of DeFi dApps, including Uniswap, Curve, and Balancer, with ~$1T in query volume.
- **Scalability**: Layer-2 integrations (e.g., Arbitrum) reduce query costs by 90% compared to Ethereum L1.

## GRT Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Sunrise Upgrade (Q1 2025)**: Transitioned indexing to fully decentralized, boosting query efficiency by 20%.
- **Layer-2 Expansion (March 2025)**: Added Optimism and Base support, reducing costs for subgraph queries.
- **AI Subgraphs (June 2025)**: Introduced AI-driven data indexing, enhancing real-time analytics for dApps.

## How Is GRT Secured?

The Graph and GRT are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Staking Penalties**: Indexers stake GRT, with slashing for malicious behavior, ensuring data integrity.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin maintain protocol safety.
- **Decentralized Governance**: GRT holders and council vote on upgrades, preventing centralized control.

## Conclusion

**The Graph (GRT)** is a critical Web3 infrastructure, indexing blockchain data for dApps with a 9.5B circulating supply. Integrated across 200+ exchanges and supporting 40,000+ subgraphs, GRT’s decentralized model and 2025 upgrades like Sunrise position it as a DeFi backbone. While competition from newer indexing protocols exists, The Graph’s broad adoption and scalability make it indispensable in Web3.
