# What Is Hedera (HBAR)?

**Hedera (HBAR)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera Hashgraph, a decentralized, enterprise-grade public network launched in 2018. Unlike traditional blockchains, [Hedera](https://hedera.com/) uses a unique distributed ledger technology (DLT) called Hashgraph, designed for high-speed transactions, low fees, and sustainability. Governed by a council of global organizations, including Google, IBM, and Boeing, Hedera powers decentralized applications (dApps), smart contracts, and services like tokenization and data integrity, targeting enterprise and Web3 adoption. 

## Key Features
- **Hashgraph Consensus**: Utilizes a leaderless, asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (aBFT) consensus for fast, secure transactions.
- **High Throughput**: Processes thousands of transactions per second with fixed low fees ($0.0001 per transaction).
- **Sustainability**: Carbon-negative network with minimal environmental impact due to no mining.
- **Enterprise Governance**: Managed by a decentralized council of up to 39 global organizations across 11 industries.

## HBAR Token
- **Purpose**: Powers network services (smart contracts, file storage, transaction fees), staking, and governance.
- **Supply**: ~42.39B HBAR in circulation, with a maximum supply of 50B.
- **Contract Address**: 0x000000000000000000000000000000000006f84a (Hedera native). Add to wallets like MetaMask for EVM-compatible interactions [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/hedera/) [COINGECKO](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/hedera).


## Who Are the Founders of Hedera?
Hedera was co-founded by Dr. Leemon Baird, inventor of the Hashgraph algorithm, and Mance Harmon, a cybersecurity and tech executive. Launched via an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018, the mainnet went live in September 2019. The Hedera Governing Council, including entities like Google and IBM, oversees development.
