# What Is Story (IP)?

**Story (IP)**, launched in August 2024, is the native token of the [Story Protocol](https://www.storyprotocol.xyz/), a purpose-built Layer 1 blockchain designed to tokenize and manage intellectual property (IP) on-chain. Story enables creators to register, license, and monetize IP—such as ideas, images, songs, AI models, or NFTs—with programmable usage terms, attribution, and royalties embedded in the blockchain. IP powers governance, staking, and transaction fees.

## Key Features
- **IP Tokenization**: Converts any IP into programmable assets, enabling transparent licensing and royalty distribution.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Supports Ethereum-based tools, facilitating dApp development for IP management.
- **AI Integration**: Enhances creator tools with AI, powering apps like MusicByVirtuals and EmergenceVerse.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes high-profile IPs from Netflix, crypto culture, and a Surreal Buildathon for developer onboarding.

## IP Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, transaction fees, and incentivizing IP registration.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~290 million IP, with a max supply of 1 billion.
- **Contract Address**: `0x0c8aF56dA0b53E3bF6c5A6F744fC0C2E16eA7D67` (Ethereum, addable to MetaMask), tradeable via [www.coingecko.com/en/coins/story](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/story).


# Who Are the Founders of Story?

Story was co-founded by **Jason Zhao**, an open-source AI and decentralization advocate, alongside a team backed by $140 million from investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), who led three funding rounds. The Story Foundation governs the protocol, with IP holders driving decentralized decision-making.
