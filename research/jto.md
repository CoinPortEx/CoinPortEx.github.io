# What Is Jito (JTO)?

**Jito (JTO)** is the native governance token of the Jito Network, a liquid staking and maximum extractable value (MEV) protocol built on the Solana blockchain. Launched on December 7, 2023, [Jito](https://www.jito.network/) enables users to stake Solana (SOL) and receive JitoSOL, a liquid staking token that combines staking rewards with MEV profits. Designed to enhance Solana’s validator economy, Jito promotes transparency, decentralization, and equitable profit distribution through its open-source validator client and community-driven DAO. 

## Key Features
- **Liquid Staking**: Users stake SOL to receive JitoSOL, maintaining liquidity for DeFi while earning staking and MEV rewards.
- **MEV Redistribution**: Distributes MEV profits transparently via TipRouter, with 2.7% to Jito DAO and 0.15% each to JitoSOL and JTO stakers.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Leverages Solana’s high-throughput, low-cost PoS consensus for fast and secure transactions.
- **StakeNet**: Uses on-chain validator metrics and automated algorithms to optimize stake allocation and network security.

## JTO Token
- **Purpose**: Facilitates governance, staking, fee auctions, and access to Jito’s ecosystem, including JitoSOL rewards.
- **Supply**: ~350M JTO in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Solana blockchain; compatible with wallets like Phantom or Solflare for DeFi and trading [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/jito) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/jito/).


## Who Are the Founders of Jito?
Jito was developed by Jito Labs, with key contributions from Brian Smith (Executive Director) and Nick Almond (Head of Governance). Backed by investors like Multicoin Capital, Alameda Research, and Delphi Ventures, Jito raised significant funding to build its MEV and staking infrastructure. The Jito Foundation, established to manage the DAO, oversees community governance and protocol development.

## What Makes Jito Unique?
Jito stands out in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **MEV Transparency**: Mitigates negative MEV impacts through an open-source validator client and fair profit distribution.
- **JitoSOL Advantage**: Combines staking yield (~7–8% APY) with MEV rewards, outperforming standard SOL staking.
- **Validator Optimization**: StakeNet’s algorithms enhance validator performance, boosting Solana’s decentralization.
- **Community Governance**: JTO holders shape protocol decisions, including fee structures and treasury management.

## Jito Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Jito Market Scaling (January 2025)**: Boosted JitoSOL exposure on Kamino Finance with a 12.5x multiplier and ~100K JTO/month incentives, growing TVL to ~17.87M SOL.
- **Shredstream Integration (March 2025)**: Implemented multicast for efficient packet broadcasting, enhancing validator communication.
- **Strategic Ecosystem Reserve (April 2025)**: Supported Solana Strategies’ SER with 52,181 JTO to fund infrastructure and DeFi projects.
- **Token Transparency Framework (June 2025)**: Joined Blockworks’ initiative to enhance governance transparency and community trust.

## How Is Jito Secured?

- **Solana PoS Consensus**: Inherits Solana’s secure, validator-driven consensus with instant finality.
- **StakeNet Security**: Uses tamper-resistant validator metrics for transparent stake allocation.
- **TipRouter NCN**: Ensures fair and transparent MEV reward distribution across stakeholders.


## Conclusion
**Jito (JTO)** is a transformative liquid staking and MEV protocol enhancing Solana’s DeFi ecosystem. With backing from Multicoin Capital and Alameda Research, Jito’s 2025 upgrades like Shredstream and transparency initiatives position it as a leader in decentralized staking and validator efficiency.
