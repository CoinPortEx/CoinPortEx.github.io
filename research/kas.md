# What Is Kaspa (KAS)?

**Kaspa (KAS)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Kaspa blockchain, a decentralized layer-1 Proof-of-Work (PoW) network launched in November 2021. Kaspa utilizes the GHOSTDAG protocol, a novel blockDAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) structure, enabling parallel block processing for high transaction throughput and near-instant confirmations. Designed for scalability and decentralization, [Kaspa](https://kaspa.org/) targets 10 blocks per second (BPS) with ambitions of reaching 100 BPS, making it one of the fastest PoW networks. 

## Key Features
- **BlockDAG Technology**: Uses GHOSTDAG to allow parallel blocks to coexist, unlike traditional blockchains, enabling high throughput (currently 10 BPS).
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW)**: Maintains Bitcoin-like security and decentralization without requiring specialized hardware, running efficiently on standard PCs.
- **Fast Confirmations**: Achieves near-instant transaction finality, limited only by internet latency.
- **KRC-20 Ecosystem**: Supports tokens like KDAO, KANGO, and KONAN, fostering meme coins and utility projects.

## KAS Token
- **Purpose**: Powers transaction fees, mining rewards, and supports the KRC-20 token ecosystem.
- **Supply**: ~26.41B KAS in circulation, with a maximum supply of ~28.7B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Kaspa blockchain; compatible with wallets like Kaspium or KDX for trading and staking [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kaspa) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kaspa/).


## Who Are the Founders of Kaspa?
Kaspa was founded by a team of cryptographers and developers led by Yonatan Sompolinsky, a co-author of the GHOST protocol. The project was fair-launched without an ICO, premine, or pre-allocation, ensuring community-driven development. The Kaspa community, including treasurers managing a multi-signature dev fund, oversees governance.

## What Makes Kaspa Unique?
Kaspa stands out in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **GHOSTDAG Protocol**: Enables parallel block processing, achieving high scalability without sacrificing security.
- **Chromatic Monetary Policy**: Reduces block rewards monthly by (1/2)^(1/12), mimicking musical note ratios, ensuring predictable emission.
- **Accessibility**: Full nodes run on standard PCs, promoting decentralization and aligning with Bitcoin’s ethos.
- **Growing Ecosystem**: Supports KRC-20 tokens (e.g., KDAO, KANGO, KONAN) and layer-2 solutions for DeFi and memecoins.

## Kaspa Network Upgrades (2024–2025)
- **Crescendo Hardfork (2024)**: Increased block rate to 10 BPS, enhancing throughput and stability.
- **Rust Rewrite (2024)**: Transitioned core code from Golang to Rust, optimizing performance for higher BPS.
- **Testnet-10 Hardfork (2025)**: Successfully tested 10 BPS, paving the way for future scalability improvements.
- **Kaspium Wallet Update (June 2025)**: Improved UX for KRC-20 token support and mobile accessibility.

## How Is Kaspa Secured?

- **PoW Consensus**: Uses kHeavyHash algorithm, ensuring miner-driven security and decentralization.
- **GHOSTDAG Security**: Maintains consensus integrity across parallel blocks, resistant to 51% attacks.
- **Pruning Mechanism**: Efficiently manages disk usage while preserving cryptographic integrity.


## Conclusion
**Kaspa (KAS)** is a high-performance layer-1 blockchain leveraging the GHOSTDAG protocol to achieve unparalleled speed and scalability in a PoW network. Kaspa combines Bitcoin’s security with modern scalability, supporting a growing KRC-20 ecosystem. Its fair launch, community governance, and ongoing upgrades position Kaspa as a leading contender for decentralized applications.
