# What Is  LEO (LEO)?

**UNUS SED LEO (LEO)**, launched in May 2019 by [iFinex](https://www.ifinex.com/), the parent company of Bitfinex, is a utility token designed to enhance the Bitfinex exchange ecosystem. Named after the Latin phrase "One, but a Lion," LEO symbolizes strength and utility. Issued on Ethereum (660 million ERC-20 tokens) and EOS (340 million tokens), LEO offers trading fee discounts, lending benefits, and governance participation. Its token burn mechanism reduces supply over time, aiming for eventual full redemption.

## Key Features
- **Utility**: Provides up to 25% discounts on trading, withdrawal, and lending fees on Bitfinex, with tiered benefits based on LEO holdings.
- **Dual Blockchain**: Operates on Ethereum and EOS, with seamless cross-chain conversions.
- **Token Burn**: iFinex buys back and burns tokens monthly using at least 27% of its consolidated gross revenue, reducing the total supply.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports Bitfinex’s trading platform, IEO participation, and future iFinex services.

## LEO Token
- **Purpose**: Used for fee reductions, margin trading collateral, and community governance via polls.
- **Supply**: Total supply of 985.24 million, with ~923.34 million in circulation as of June 2025.
- **Price (June 2025)**: ~$9.11 USD, up 0.77% daily, with a market cap of $8.41 billion (ranked #19).
- **Initial Sale**: Raised $1 billion in a 10-day IEO in 2019, selling 1 billion tokens at $1 each (pegged to USDT).


# Who Are the Founders of LEO?

LEO was created by **iFinex**, the parent company of Bitfinex. Key figures include:

- **Jean-Louis van der Velde**: CEO of iFinex and Bitfinex, driving strategic vision.
- **Giancarlo Devasini**: CFO, overseeing financial operations and the LEO token sale.

The token was launched to address a $850 million shortfall after funds were seized from Crypto Capital, Bitfinex’s payment processor, in 2018. The IEO raised $1 billion to stabilize operations.

# What Makes LEO Unique?

LEO stands out for its integration into the Bitfinex ecosystem and deflationary model:

- **Fee Discounts**: Offers up to 25% reductions on trading and withdrawal fees, scaling with holdings (e.g., 15% taker fee discount for any LEO balance).
- **Token Burn**: Monthly buybacks using 27% of iFinex revenue, with additional burns from recovered 2016 hack funds (80%) and 2018 seizure funds (95%), aiming to eliminate all tokens.
- **Governance**: Holders participate in community polls, influencing Bitfinex platform development.
- **Dual Blockchain**: Ethereum and EOS compatibility enhances flexibility for users and developers.

Unlike many cryptocurrencies, LEO is not designed for perpetual existence, with its burn mechanism targeting full redemption.
