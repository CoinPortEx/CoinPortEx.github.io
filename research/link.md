# What Is Chainlink (LINK)?

**Chainlink (LINK)**, launched in September 2017, is a decentralized oracle network built on Ethereum, enabling smart contracts to securely interact with off-chain data, APIs, and traditional systems. [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) connects blockchains to real-world data, powering DeFi, tokenized assets, and cross-chain applications. Its native token, **LINK**, incentivizes node operators and facilitates payments. 

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Oracles**: Provides reliable data feeds (e.g., price, weather) to smart contracts, securing over $75B in DeFi value.
- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**: The Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) enables seamless data and asset transfers across 20+ blockchains, including Ethereum, Solana, and Polygon.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates on 20+ ecosystems, including Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche, with 1,000+ project integrations.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports 700+ oracle networks, integrated with 223+ exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance) and wallets like MetaMask.

## LINK Token
- **Purpose**: Used for paying node operators, staking, and governance participation.
- **Supply**: ~660M LINK in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1B 
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, LINK’s contract is `0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/chainlink) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/chainlink/).

## Who Are the Founders of LINK?

Chainlink was founded by **Sergey Nazarov** and **Steve Ellis** in 2017, with **Ari Juels** as a key technical advisor. Backed by Chainlink Labs, the project raised $32M during its 2017 ICO. Notable advisors include **Eric Schmidt** (ex-Google CEO). The Chainlink community drives development through open-source contributions and node operations.

## What Makes LINK Unique?

Chainlink stands out in Web3:
- **Oracle Reliability**: Aggregates data from multiple sources to ensure accuracy, powering DeFi apps like Aave, Synthetix, and Compound.
- **CCIP Scalability**: Facilitates cross-chain communication, securing billions in asset transfers across public and private blockchains.
- **Staking Incentives**: Offers ~5% annual staking rewards, combining treasury emissions and user fees, enhancing network security.
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Partners with AccuWeather, FedEx, and the Associated Press for data verification, bridging traditional and blockchain systems.

## LINK Network Upgrades (2025)
- **CCIP Expansion (Q1 2025)**: Added support for Base and Scroll, increasing cross-chain transaction volume by 30% 
- **Data Streams V2 (April 2025)**: Improved sub-second price feeds for high-frequency trading, adopted by HyperLend ($480M TVL).
- **DVT Integration (June 2025)**: Enhanced node decentralization with Distributed Validator Technology, reducing single-point risks.

## How Is LINK Secured?

Chainlink and LINK are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Decentralized Nodes**: Over 700 node operators aggregate data, minimizing manipulation risks.
- **Staking Penalties**: Node operators stake LINK, which can be slashed for inaccurate data, ensuring reliability.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits maintain protocol integrity.

## Conclusion

**Chainlink (LINK)** is a critical Web3 infrastructure, bridging blockchains with real-world data through decentralized oracles. With ,660M circulating LINK, and 1,000+ integrations, it powers DeFi, cross-chain interoperability, and enterprise adoption. Its robust security, staking model, and CCIP scalability position Chainlink as a backbone of blockchain innovation.
