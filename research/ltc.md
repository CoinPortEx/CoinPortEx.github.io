# What Is Litecoin (LTC)?

**Litecoin (LTC)**, launched in October 2011, is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency on the **Litecoin blockchain**, a decentralized, open-source Layer 1 blockchain forked from Bitcoin. Created by Charlie Lee, [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org/) is designed for fast, low-cost digital payments, positioning itself as the "digital silver" to Bitcoin’s "digital gold." LTC powers transaction fees, mining rewards, and governance within its ecosystem.

## Key Features
- **Fast Transactions**: Generates blocks every 2.5 minutes, 4x faster than Bitcoin’s 10 minutes, enabling quick confirmations.
- **Low Fees**: Average transaction cost of ~$0.01, ideal for microtransactions and point-of-sale payments.
- **Scrypt Algorithm**: Uses memory-intensive Scrypt for Proof-of-Work (PoW), originally enabling GPU mining but now dominated by ASICs.
- **Ecosystem**: Accepted by thousands of merchants globally, with integrations on major exchanges like Binance and Coinbase.

## LTC Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, mining rewards, and as a store of value or payment method.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~76 million LTC, with a max supply of 84 million.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Litecoin blockchain; tradeable via [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/). Add to wallets like Litecoin Core or Exodus.

# Who Are the Founders of Litecoin?

Litecoin was founded by **Charlie Lee**, a former Google engineer and Coinbase Director of Engineering. Launched via an open-source client on GitHub, Lee envisioned Litecoin as a faster, lighter alternative to Bitcoin. The Litecoin Foundation, led by Lee, Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin, and Zing Yang, supports development and adoption.

# What Makes Litecoin Unique?

Litecoin stands out for its payment-focused design:

- **Speed and Scalability**: 2.5-minute block times and larger blocks handle higher transaction volumes than Bitcoin.
- **MimbleWimble Extension Block (MWEB)**: Adds optional privacy via confidential transactions, though it led to delistings in South Korea due to regulatory concerns.
- **Merchant Adoption**: Used for payments by 14% of BitPay transactions, ranking third behind Bitcoin and USDT.
- **Decentralized Mining**: Scrypt initially deterred ASIC dominance, fostering wider miner participation, though ASICs now prevail.

# LTC Network Upgrades (2025)

- **MWEB Expansion (Q1 2025)**: Enhanced privacy features, improving fungibility despite regulatory pushback in some markets.
- **LitVM Launch (June 2025)**: Introduced a ZK-powered omnichain layer with Polygon CDK and AggLayer, adding smart contracts and interoperability.
- **ETF Proposals (June 2025)**: Canary and Grayscale filed for spot LTC ETFs, driving 31.5% volume increase to $464.6M daily.

# How Is LTC Secured?

Litecoin and LTC are secured through:

- **PoW Consensus**: Scrypt-based mining secures the network, with miners solving cryptographic puzzles to validate transactions.
- **Decentralized Nodes**: Over 10,000 nodes globally ensure network resilience and prevent double-spending.
- **ChainLocks**: Mitigates 51% attacks by locking blocks via masternode-like consensus, inspired by Dash.
- **Audits**: Regular code audits by the Litecoin Core team and third parties maintain protocol integrity.

# Conclusion

**Litecoin (LTC)** powers a fast, low-cost blockchain optimized for digital payments, complementing Bitcoin as “digital silver.” With its Scrypt algorithm, MWEB privacy features, and growing merchant adoption, Litecoin remains a top altcoin. Recent upgrades like LitVM and ETF momentum position it for broader adoption.
