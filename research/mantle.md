# What Is Mantle (MNT)?

**Mantle (MNT)**, launched in July 2023, is the native token of the [Mantle Network](https://mantle.xyz/), a Layer 2 (L2) blockchain built on Ethereum to enhance scalability and bridge traditional finance (TradFi) with decentralized finance (DeFi). Evolving from BitDAO’s 1:1 migration, Mantle uses a modular rollup architecture with EigenLayer’s data availability (EigenDA) for low-cost, high-throughput transactions. MNT powers governance, staking, and gas fees, supporting products like mETH Protocol and Function (fBTC). The ecosystem’s $4 billion treasury and $2.5 billion total value locked (TVL) rank it #23 among blockchains.

## Key Features
- **Modular L2**: Separates execution, consensus, and data availability, achieving ~10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with sub-second finality.
- **EigenDA Integration**: First L2 to use EigenLayer’s data availability, reducing costs and enabling ETH restaking.
- **RWA and DeFi**: Offers tokenized assets like fBTC and stablecoins (USDe, USDY), with $7.2 billion in RWA market share.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes mETH ($693M TVL), fBTC, and dApps like FunnyMoney and Infinit, with a $200M EcoFund for growth.

## MNT Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, gas fees, and ecosystem incentives.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~3.4 billion MNT, with a max supply of 6.2 billion.

# Who Are the Founders of Mantle?

Mantle has no single founder, governed by the **Mantle DAO** with $MNT holders making key decisions. Early contributors **jacobc.eth** and **Ben Zhou** (Bybit CEO) proposed Mantle’s vision, evolving from BitDAO. The **Mantle Foundation** stewards a $4 billion treasury, supporting growth through grants and partnerships with Bybit, Ethena, and Ondo.

# What Makes Mantle Unique?

MNT and Mantle Network stand out for their scalability and TradFi-DeFi bridge:

- **EigenDA**: Reduces transaction costs by 80% compared to Ethereum L1, enhancing DeFi efficiency.
- **mETH Protocol**: Offers liquid ETH staking with $mETH, yielding ~4% APY, integrated across CEXs and DeFi.
- **fBTC Integration**: Bridges Bitcoin to Web3, used in Babylon and PumpBTC, unlocking BTC DeFi opportunities.
- **Treasury Power**: $4 billion treasury funds innovation, with 20% of earnings in ENA and AUSD stablecoins.

Mantle’s pivot to a full-stack on-chain finance hub, including AI agents and crypto index funds, drives its DeFi leadership.

# MNT Network Upgrades (2025)

- **DaL Program (Q2 2025)**: Launched Double Adaptive Liquidity with Hypurr, expanding $cmETH yield across Mantle and HyperEVM.
- **FunnyMoney Launch**: Introduced a token launchpad and 50x leverage trading platform with AI agents, boosting dApp adoption.
- **Stablecoin Growth**: Stablecoin market cap rose 27% QoQ, with USDe and USDY integrated across products.


# MNT and Sustainability

Mantle’s rollup architecture and EigenDA use Ethereum’s proof-of-stake, reducing energy consumption by ~99% compared to proof-of-work. No specific carbon neutrality initiatives are reported, but its modular design aligns with eco-friendly blockchain trends.

# How Is MNT Secured?

MNT and the Mantle Network are secured through:

- **Ethereum PoS**: Inherits Ethereum’s proof-of-stake security for rollup finality.
- **EigenDA**: Ensures data availability via EigenLayer’s restaking, validated by 200+ nodes.
- **Mantle DAO**: MNT holders govern protocol upgrades and treasury allocation.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: mETH Protocol and dApps undergo regular audits for safety.


# Conclusion

**Mantle (MNT)** powers a scalable L2 blockchain, bridging TradFi and DeFi with innovative products like mETH and fBTC. Its $4 billion treasury, EigenDA integration, and growing ecosystem position it as a DeFi leader.
