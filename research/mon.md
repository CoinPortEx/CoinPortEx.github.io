# What Is Monad (MON)?

**Monad (MON)**, founded in 2022, is a high-performance, fully EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain designed to solve Ethereum’s scalability limitations while keeping 100% compatibility with existing smart contracts and tools. Through parallel execution and a re-engineered architecture, [Monad](https://www.monad.xyz/) delivers 10,000 TPS with sub-second finality. Its native token, **MON**, powers transactions, staking, and ecosystem incentives.

## Key Features
- **Parallel Execution**: Processes transactions in parallel (instead of sequentially), achieving up to 10,000 TPS — more than 11× Solana’s real-world average — while remaining fully EVM bytecode compatible.
- **High TVL Growth**: Within 48 hours of mainnet launch on November 24, 2025, TVL exceeded $110M, fueled by DeFi migrations and early liquidity programs.
- **Multi-Chain Interoperability**: Native LayerZero integration (50+ chains), Monad Bridge, Mayan Finance, and Symbiosis for seamless cross-chain transfers.
- **Ecosystem**: 240+ projects building at launch (DeFi, gaming, NFTs). Day-one dApps include PancakeSwap v4, Uniswap v3, Aave, Curve, and many others. Supported by MetaMask, Rabby, Backpack, Phantom, etc.

## MON Token
- **Purpose**: Gas fees, staking for network security, governance voting, farming rewards, and airdrops.
- **Supply**: ~10.83B MON in circulation | Max supply: 100B.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Monad mainnet (check official docs for latest address).

## Who Are the Founders of MON?

Monad was founded by **Keone Hon** (CEO), **James Hunsaker** (CTO), and **Eunice Giarta** (COO) — all former Jump Trading high-frequency trading engineers. Raised $225M in April 2024 from Paradigm, Electric Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and others. In July 2025, the Monad Foundation acquired Portal Labs to strengthen stablecoin infrastructure. Governance is progressively decentralizing via MON staking.

## What Makes MON Unique?

- **Full EVM Compatibility + Extreme Performance**: Combines Ethereum developer experience with Solana-level speed via MonadBFT consensus, asynchronous execution, and MonadDB (custom SSD-optimized database that cuts validator hardware costs by ~80%).
- **Decentralization Focus**: Consumer-grade GPUs can run validators; launched with 100+ validators across 19 countries for high Nakamoto coefficient.
- **Institutional-Grade Design**: Open-source core (GPL-3.0), extensive audits, and partnerships with custodians like Anchorage Digital.

## MON Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Mainnet Launch (Nov 24, 2025)**: 0.4s block times, 1B gas/second, instant finality, TGE, public sale on Coinbase, and $MON airdrop to ~225K early community members.
- **Testnet Milestones (Feb–Aug 2025)**: Public testnet v1 peaked at 102M daily txs; added JIT EVM, BLS precompiles, and MonadBFT upgrades.
- **Ecosystem Expansions (Q3–Q4 2025)**: Portal Labs acquisition, Monad Momentum incentives, Bitget Launchpool (25M MON rewards), Symbiosis cross-chain, and 100+ committed dApps.

## How Is MON Secured?

- **Proof-of-Stake + MonadBFT**: HotStuff-derived consensus with fast finality and slashing for misbehavior.
- **Audits**: Core client audited by Statemind, ChainSecurity, Zellic, Ottersec, Certora, and top Code4rena wardens — no critical issues post-launch.
- **Decentralized Validator Set**: 100+ geographically distributed validators at mainnet.
- **Deterministic Execution**: Speculative parallel execution with conflict resolution prevents reorgs and ensures security.

## Conclusion

**Monad (MON)** is a next-generation EVM-compatible Layer-1 that launched mainnet on November 24, 2025, with 10.83B circulating supply and $110M+ TVL in the first 48 hours. Trading on 53+ exchanges (Coinbase, Bybit, Upbit, etc.) and major DEXs, its 10,000 TPS parallel architecture, sub-second finality, and 240+ ecosystem projects make it a leading scalability contender. While early price volatility and validator growth remain points to watch, Monad’s world-class team, $225M funding, and developer-friendly design could position it as a cornerstone for high-performance DeFi, gaming, and institutional adoption in Web3.
