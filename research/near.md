# What Is NEAR Protocol (NEAR)?

**NEAR Protocol (NEAR)**, launched in October 2020, is the native token of the [NEAR Protocol](https://near.org/), a Layer 1 (L1) blockchain designed for decentralized applications (dApps) with a focus on user-owned AI, DeFi, and chain abstraction. Built for scalability and usability, NEAR uses a sharded architecture and the **Nightshade** sharding protocol to achieve ~100,000 transactions per second (TPS). NEAR powers staking, governance, and transaction fees, enabling a developer-friendly ecosystem with tools like the **NEAR SDK**. The protocol’s $1.2 billion total value locked (TVL) ranks it among top L1s.

## Key Features
- **Sharding**: Nightshade splits the network into shards for parallel processing, boosting scalability.
- **Chain Abstraction**: Simplifies cross-chain interactions via NEAR Intents, enabling seamless asset swaps across chains like Polygon and Solana.
- **User-Owned AI**: Supports AI agents with confidential, multi-chain capabilities for Web3 integration.
- **Ecosystem**: Hosts dApps like Infinex, RuneShot, and Kaito, with growing DeFi and gaming sectors.

## NEAR Token
- **Purpose**: Used for staking, governance, transaction fees, and accessing AI and DeFi services.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~1.2 billion NEAR, with no fixed cap due to inflationary rewards.
- **Contract Address**: Native to NEAR L1, [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/near). [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/near-protocol/).


# Who Are the Founders of NEAR?

NEAR Protocol was co-founded by **Illia Polosukhin** and **Alexander Skidanov**, former Google and Microsoft engineers. Polosukhin, a machine learning expert, and Skidanov, a distributed systems specialist, aimed to create a scalable, developer-friendly blockchain. The **NEAR Foundation**, based in Switzerland, supports the ecosystem’s growth and governance.

# What Makes NEAR Unique?

NEAR stands out for its AI integration and user-centric design:

- **Fast Finality**: 600ms block times and 1.2-second finality, 10x faster than Solana and 600x faster than Ethereum L2s.
- **NEAR Intents**: Enables goal-driven, cross-chain transactions, integrating assets like BTC, DOGE, and POL.
- **Deflationary Pressure**: Transaction fees are burned, increasing NEAR’s scarcity as usage grows.
- **Developer Accessibility**: Web2-like UX with NEAR SDK and account abstraction lowers entry barriers.

NEAR’s partnerships with Polygon, Infinex, and RuneShot highlight its chain abstraction and DeFi focus.

# NEAR Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Shard Expansion**: Increased from 6 to 8 shards, improving performance by 33% with one-block shard splits.
- **Faster Blocks**: Reduced block time to 600ms with 1.2-second finality, setting a new L1 standard.
- **NEAR Intents Adoption**: Integrated by Polygon and Infinex, enabling cross-chain swaps for BTC, DOGE, and XRP.




# How Is NEAR Secured?

NEAR and the NEAR Protocol are secured through:

- **Thresholded Proof-of-Stake**: Validators stake NEAR to secure shards, earning rewards.
- **Nightshade Sharding**: Distributes workload across validators, enhancing decentralization.
- **Governance**: NEAR holders vote on protocol upgrades and validator sets.
- **Fee Burning**: Transaction fees are burned, aligning incentives for network security.


# Conclusion

**NEAR Protocol (NEAR)** powers a scalable L1 blockchain, blending user-owned AI, chain abstraction, and DeFi with unmatched speed and accessibility. Its sharded architecture, NEAR Intents, and growing ecosystem position it as a top contender.
