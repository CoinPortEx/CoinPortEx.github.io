# What Is Optimism (OP)?

**Optimism (OP)**, launched in June 2019, is a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, using optimistic rollups to process transactions off-chain while leveraging Ethereum’s security. [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) reduces gas fees and boosts transaction speeds for DeFi, NFTs, and dApps. Its native token, **OP**, powers governance. 

## Key Features
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Processes transactions off-chain with ~10x lower fees than Ethereum, settling on L1 for security.
- **High Throughput**: Handles up to 2,000 TPS, compared to Ethereum’s ~25 TPS, with 1-2 second finality.
- **EVM Equivalence**: Fully compatible with Ethereum’s tools, supporting dApps like Uniswap and Synthetix.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 180+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and 250+ markets, with wallet support like MetaMask and Coinbase Wallet.

## OP Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, voting on protocol upgrades, and incentivizing ecosystem growth.
- **Supply**: ~1.7B OP in circulation, with a maximum supply of 4.29B.
- **Contract Address**: On Optimism, OP’s contract is `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000042` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/optimism) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/).

## Who Are the Founders of OP?

Optimism was developed by **Optimism Labs**, founded by **Jinglan Wang**, **Ben Jones**, and **Karl Floersch**. Backed by a16z and Paradigm, Optimism raised $150M in 2022. The project transitioned to community governance via the Optimism Collective, a DAO led by OP token holders.

## What Makes OP Unique?

Optimism stands out in Web3:
- **Low-Cost Scaling**: Reduces Ethereum transaction costs by 90%+, ideal for DeFi and NFT marketplaces.
- **Retroactive Funding**: Allocates 20% of OP supply to public goods via grants, funding 500+ projects.
- **Superchain Vision**: Aims to unify layer-2 networks (e.g., Base, Zora) for seamless interoperability.
- **Developer-Friendly**: EVM equivalence simplifies dApp migration from Ethereum.

## OP Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Fault Proofs (Q1 2025)**: Introduced decentralized validation, reducing reliance on centralized sequencers.
- **Superchain Expansion (March 2025)**: Integrated Base and Zora, increasing cross-chain TVL by 15%.
- **Gas Optimization (June 2025)**: Lowered rollup fees by 20%, boosting dApp adoption.

## How Is OP Secured?

Optimism and OP are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Inherits Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake security for rollup settlements.
- **Optimistic Rollups**: Uses fraud proofs (upgraded in 2025) to ensure transaction validity, with a 7-day challenge period.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin maintain protocol integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: OP holders vote on upgrades, ensuring decentralized control.

## Conclusion

**Optimism (OP)** is a leading Ethereum layer-2, enhancing scalability with optimistic rollups. With 1.3B circulating supply and 180+ exchange listings, OP drives DeFi and NFT innovation. Its Superchain vision, 2025 fault proof upgrades, and low-cost transactions position Optimism as a Web3 scalability leader, though sequencer centralization remains a concern.
