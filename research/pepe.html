<h1>What Is PEPE?</h1>
<p>PEPE is a deflationary memecoin launched on Ethereum. The cryptocurrency was created as a tribute to the Pepe the Frog internet meme, created by Matt Furie, which gained popularity in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>The project aims to capitalize on the popularity of meme coins, like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, and strives to establish itself as one of the top meme-based cryptocurrencies. PEPE appeals to the cryptocurrency community by instituting a no-tax policy, a redistributive system rewarding long-term stakers, and a burning mechanism to maintain scarcity of the PEPE coin.</p>
<p>The PEPE roadmap features three phases, where phase one includes listing on CoinMarketCap, and getting $PEPE trending on Twitter, while phase two includes listing on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and phase three includes “tier 1” exchange listings and what the team terms a “meme takeover.”</p>

<h2>Who Are the Founders of PEPE?</h2>
<p>As of now, the founders of PEPE remain anonymous, which is not uncommon in the cryptocurrency world. Although information about the team behind the project is scarce, they have successfully garnered attention using social media platforms such as Twitter to promote their meme coin and foster a community around the memecoin.</p>

<h2>What Makes PEPE Unique?</h2>
<p>PEPE presents a unique offering within the meme coin market by building upon the legacy of Pepe the Frog, a character with a longstanding and controversial history. The project's dedication to honoring this character distinguishes it from other cryptocurrencies and strengthens its appeal within the crypto community.</p>
<p>The redistribution system is another unique aspect of PEPE, as it rewards long-term stakers and incentivizes users to hold the token for longer periods of time. In doing so, the project aims to promote holder incentives and increase the chances of long-term success.</p>
<p>PEPE's burning mechanism further highlights its distinct nature, aiming to maintain scarcity within the market. Finally, the no-tax policy makes PEPE stand out from other cryptocurrencies. By not imposing transaction fees, the project can attract a wider audience and expand its user base.</p>

<h2>How Many PEPE Coins Are There in Circulation?</h2>
<p>PEPE employs a redistribution system that rewards long-term stakers, offering them incentives to remain committed to the project. This approach encourages coin stability by rewarding users for holding the token rather than selling it quickly. Additionally, PEPE features a burning mechanism whereby a portion of the coins are permanently removed from circulation on a regular basis. This aims to maintain scarcity despite the coin's 420,690,000,000,000 maximum supply.</p>
<p>Of the maximum supply, 93.1% were sent to the liquidity pool on Uniswap, where LP tokens were burnt, and the deployer contract was sent to a null address. The remaining 6.9% is held in a multi-sig wallet, for future CEX listings, bridges and liquidity pools. This wallet can be tracked using the ENS name “pepecexwallet.eth.” Users can track the PEPE/WETH pair on CMC DexScan.</p>

<h2>How Is PEPE Secured?</h2>
<p>PEPE is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, which is secured by the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Decentralized validators stake 32 ETH to process transactions and secure the network.</p>
