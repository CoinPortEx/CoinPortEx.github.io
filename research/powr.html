<h1>Powerledger (POWR)</h1>

<h2>What is Powerledger (POWR)?</h2>
<p>Powerledger (POWR) is a technology company that builds software for distributed and decentralised energy markets for a sustainable future. It has developed a blockchain-based platform that enables the tracking and trading of energy, flexibility services and environmental commodities. Its goal is to provide the platform for a fully modernized, market-driven grid that offers consumers a choice in their energy while driving the democratization of power.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Australia, Powerledger has over 30 clients across 11 countries, with representatives around the globe. Powerledger operates on two blockchain layers and uses two tokens, the Powerledger (POWR) and Sparkz tokens. The platform itself uses the public Ethereum blockchain and a private consortium blockchain known as EcoChain™.</p>
<p>The POWR token is an ERC-20 token that acts as a licence required for businesses such as; utilities, renewable energy operators, microgrids, companies committed to 100% renewable energy and property developers to access Powerledger’s platform. POWR is traded through the Ethereum Smart Bond exchange.</p>
<p>In 2015, 30 countries had reached grid parity, meaning that the price of solar-generated energy was equal to or less than the cost of local retail electricity. Powerledger combines renewable energy and blockchain technology to offer energy solutions that are cheaper and more sustainable than traditional energy alternatives.</p>

<h2>POWR staking</h2>
<p>Powerledger’s Proof-of-Stake Energy Blockchain allows Powerledger to build and scale energy projects across the globe, processing 50,000+ energy transactions per second. To be part of securing Powerledger’s Energy Blockchain, stake your POWR allowing you to be part of the renewable energy transaction and earn rewards.</p>

<h2>Who are the founders of Powerledger?</h2>
<p>Powerledger (POWR) was co-founded by Dr Jemma Green and John Bulich in 2016.</p>
<p>Dr Jemma Green is the executive chairman of Powerledger. After a decade in corporate finance in the UK, Dr Green returned home to Perth to pursue a doctorate at Curtin University in electricity market disruption, which she completed in 2017. This work turned out to be the perfect segue to founding Powerledger.</p>
<p>John Bulich is the technical director at Powerledger. Before co-founding Powerledger, he was a co-founder and director of Ledger Assets and a director at WA Property Investments.</p>

<h2>What makes Powerledger unique?</h2>
<p>Powerledger’s products include uGrid, xGrid, TraceX, Vision, Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) Vision, Mode Flex and Local Energy Market (LEM). The blockchain-based platform can be contracted separately and scaled as needed. The products are divided into three key pillars. Energy trading and traceability, flexibility trading and environmental commodities trading.</p>
<p>Energy trading and traceability. Track and trade features help you stay on top of the provenance and flow of energy. It can give consumers choice over the energy they're using and facilitate peer to peer (P2P) trading. Solar P2P energy trading can deal with excess solar in the grid without subsidy.</p>
<p>Flexibility trading. MODE or Marketplace for Optimisation of Distributed Energy, is a marketplace, which enables Distributed Energy Resource (DER) owners and flexible loads to provide grid services to monetise their assets.</p>
<p>Environmental commodities trading. The technology is being used to ensure the trading of environmental commodities such as renewable energy certificates and carbon credits, are more transparent, secure, and efficient.</p>
