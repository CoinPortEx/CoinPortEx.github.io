# What Is Powerledger (POWR)?

**Powerledger (POWR)**, launched in 2016, is a blockchain-based platform focused on decentralized energy markets, enabling peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, tracking, and tracing of renewable energy and environmental commodities. Headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, [Powerledger](https://powerledger.io/) uses blockchain to democratize energy access, allowing consumers to buy, sell, and manage surplus energy from sources like solar panels. Its native token, **POWR**, is an ERC-20 token on Ethereum.

## Key Features
- **P2P Energy Trading**: Facilitates direct energy trading between producers and consumers, with projects like a 1,000+ participant initiative in India.
- **Dual Blockchain**: Operates on Ethereum for POWR tokens and a Solana-based blockchain for scalable energy transactions.
- **Traceability**: Tracks renewable energy usage (e.g., solar, wind) and environmental credits, ensuring transparency.
- **Ecosystem**: Available on 115+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and integrated with wallets like MetaMask and Ledger.

## POWR Token
- **Purpose**: Acts as a license for businesses (e.g., utilities, microgrids) to access the Powerledger platform and pay for transactions.
- **Supply**: ~530M POWR in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1B.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, POWR’s contract is `0x595832f8fc6bf59c85c527fec3740a1b7a361269` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/power-ledger) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/).

## Who Are the Founders of POWR?

Powerledger was co-founded by **Dr. Jemma Green**, Executive Chairman, whose doctorate in electricity market disruption inspired the project, and **John Bulich**, Technical Director and blockchain pioneer from Ledger Assets. Founded in Australia, Powerledger raised ~$26M in a 2017 ICO. The platform operates globally with partners like Energie Steiermark (Austria) and TDED (Thailand).

## What Makes POWR Unique?

Powerledger stands out in Web3:
- **Energy Democratization**: Enables consumers to control and monetize surplus energy, addressing grid intermittency from renewables.
- **Global Impact**: Operates in 10+ countries, with projects like India’s largest P2P trading initiative with Calcutta Electricity Supply Corporation.
- **Scalable Blockchain**: Uses a Solana-based chain for high-speed transactions (~50,000 per second), complementing Ethereum’s security.
- **Award-Winning**: Recognized by the Renewable Energy Markets Award and as a top 50 Crypto Valley company in 2024.

## POWR Network Upgrades (2025)
- **TraceX Forwards (Q1 2025)**: Introduced price certainty for renewable energy credits (RECs), boosting market access for buyers and generators.
- **Wormhole Integration (February 2025)**: Enabled cross-chain POWR transfers via Wormhole’s NTT, enhancing interoperability.
- **DePIN Association (April 2025)**: Became a founding member, advancing decentralized physical infrastructure networks.

## How Is POWR Secured?

Powerledger and POWR are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for POWR token security.
- **Solana-Based Blockchain**: Uses Proof-of-Stake for scalable energy transactions, with staking via the Powerledger platform.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits (e.g., by CertiK) ensure contract integrity.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven decisions with no centralized control.

## Conclusion

**Powerledger (POWR)** pioneers decentralized energy markets, empowering consumers to trade and track renewable energy. With a 530M circulating supply, and operations in 10+ countries, POWR drives sustainable energy solutions. Its dual-blockchain approach, global partnerships, and recognition as a Crypto Valley leader make it a key player in Web3’s energy sector.
