# What Is Quant (QNT)?

**Quant (QNT)**, launched in June 2018, is an Ethereum-based project addressing blockchain interoperability through its **Overledger** operating system. Developed by [Quant](https://quant.network/) Network, Overledger enables seamless communication between blockchains and legacy systems, fostering multi-chain applications (MApps). The native token, **QNT**, facilitates access to Overledger and governance. 

## Key Features
- **Interoperability**: Overledger connects blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, Bitcoin) and non-blockchain networks, enabling cross-chain data and asset transfers.
- **Multi-Chain Applications (MApps)**: Developers use QNT to build MApps, supporting use cases in finance, healthcare, and supply chains.
- **Enterprise Focus**: Partners with institutions like Oracle and LACChain, targeting $20T financial markets.
- **Ecosystem**: QNT trades on 135+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and integrates with wallets like MetaMask.

## QNT Token
- **Purpose**: Used for licensing Overledger access, transaction fees, and governance voting.
- **Supply**: ~12M QNT in circulation, with a maximum supply of 14.88M.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, QNT’s contract is `0x4a220e6096b25eadb88358cb44068a3248254675` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/quant) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/quant/).

## Who Are the Founders of QNT?

Quant was founded by **Gilbert Verdian**, who conceived Overledger while working in healthcare cybersecurity. Verdian, with 20+ years in security (e.g., Vocalink, NSW Ambulance), partnered with **Colin Paterson** (CTO) and others to launch Quant Network in London. The project raised $11M via a 2018 ICO, with no further funding rounds.

## What Makes QNT Unique?

Quant stands out in Web3:
- **First Blockchain OS**: Overledger acts as an agnostic gateway, connecting blockchains without requiring new protocols, unlike Polkadot or Chainlink.
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Partnerships with SIA and Oracle position Quant for institutional use, with Overledger handling 10M+ transactions annually.
- **Patented Technology**: Fully patented APIs ensure compliance with global standards bodies.
- **Layer-2.5 Potential**: Recent updates like Overledger Fusion (June 2025) introduced hybrid interoperability for public and private chains.

## QNT Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Overledger Fusion (Q2 2025)**: Launched “Layer-2.5” network, enhancing public blockchain access for institutions and DeFi.
- **Quant Money Flow (March 2025)**: Enabled tokenized payments for cross-chain financial settlements, processing $500M in testnet volume.
- **Wormhole Integration (June 2025)**: Added cross-chain token transfers via Wormhole, boosting interoperability.

## How Is QNT Secured?

QNT and Quant are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for token security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure Overledger’s integrity.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: APIs comply with ISO 27001 and GDPR standards, critical for institutional partners.
- **Staking Requirements**: Developers stake QNT for MApp access, aligning incentives with network reliability.
