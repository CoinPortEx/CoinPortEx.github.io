# What Is Render (RENDER)?

**Render (RENDER)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Render Network, a decentralized layer-1 GPU compute platform launched in 2017 and migrated to Solana in 2024. Built by OTOY and facilitated by the Render Network Foundation, it connects node operators with idle GPU power to creators and developers for applications like 3D rendering, machine learning, and generative AI. [Render](https://rendernetwork.com/) aims to democratize access to high-performance computing for the digital economy. 

## Key Features
- **Decentralized GPU Computing**: Enables peer-to-peer GPU resource sharing for tasks like 3D rendering, AI model training, and virtual production.
- **Solana Integration**: Leverages Solana’s high throughput and low fees after migrating from Ethereum in 2024.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Uses Solana’s PoS consensus for efficient, secure transaction processing.
- **AI and DePIN Focus**: Powers AI-driven applications and Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN), with $2.5B in tokenized compute assets.

## RENDER Token
- **Purpose**: Facilitates compute payments, staking, governance, and access to Render Network services.
- **Supply**: ~520M RENDER in circulation, with a maximum supply of ~644M. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Solana (post-2024 migration); Compatible with wallets like Phantom or MetaMask [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/render) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/render/).


## Who Are the Founders of Render?
Render was conceived in 2009 by Jules Urbach, CEO of OTOY, a cloud rendering company. The Render Network launched its token sale in 2017, with private sales in 2018. The Render Network Foundation, established to oversee development, drives its decentralized ecosystem.

## What Makes Render Unique?
Render stands out in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **Decentralized Compute Power**: Connects idle GPUs to creators, reducing costs for AI, 3D rendering, and virtual production.
- **Solana Migration**: Enhances scalability and reduces fees compared to its Ethereum-based origins.
- **AI and Metaverse Applications**: Supports generative AI, machine learning, and NFT-based digital assets, aligning with DePIN and AI trends.
- **Industry Backing**: Partnerships with Google, Microsoft, and NVIDIA for GPU support and integration with tools like Apple Vision Pro.

## Render Network Upgrades (2024–2025)
- **Solana Migration (2024)**: Transitioned from Ethereum to Solana, introducing burn-mint tokenomics for sustainability.
- **Burn-Mint Tokenomics (2024)**: Implemented to stabilize RENDER’s economy by burning and minting tokens based on network usage.
- **Nosana and FEDML Integration (2024)**: Added compute clients for AI model training and generative AI tasks.
- **Gas Station (June 2025)**: Eliminated gas fees for users, improving accessibility for dApps and creators.

## How Is Render Secured?
Render’s security is robust:
- **Solana PoS Consensus**: Leverages Solana’s secure, energy-efficient consensus mechanism.
- **Decentralized Network**: Distributes GPU compute across global nodes, reducing single points of failure.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Ensures secure transactions and compute job execution.


## Conclusion
**Render (RENDER)** is a pioneering layer-1 platform revolutionizing decentralized GPU computing for AI, 3D rendering, and metaverse applications. Its Solana migration, burn-mint tokenomics, and partnerships with tech giants like Google and NVIDIA position it as a leader in the DePIN and AI crypto sectors.
