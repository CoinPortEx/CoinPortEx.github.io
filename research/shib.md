# What Is Shiba Inu (SHIB)?

**Shiba Inu (SHIB)**, launched in August 2020, is an Ethereum-based memecoin inspired by Dogecoin and the Shiba Inu dog breed. Created as a decentralized, community-driven token, [SHIB](https://shib.io/) has evolved into an ecosystem with DeFi, NFTs, and a layer-2 solution called Shibarium. 

## Key Features
- **Shibarium Layer-2**: A layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum, launched in 2023, offering low-cost transactions and hosting dApps (~1.2M wallets, $10M TVL).
- **Ecosystem Tokens**: Includes SHIB (main token), LEASH (limited supply), and BONE (governance for Shibarium).
- **Community Engagement**: Over 1.4M Twitter followers and 500K+ community members drive adoption via social campaigns.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 200+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and supports wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.

## Who Are the Founders of SHIB?

Shiba Inu was created by an anonymous developer or group known as **Ryoshi**. Launched without an ICO, SHIB gained traction through community efforts and endorsements, notably by Vitalik Buterin, who burned 90% of his donated SHIB tokens ($6B+ in 2021). The project operates as a decentralized community with no formal leadership.

## What Makes SHIB Unique?

Shiba Inu stands out in Web3:
- **Memecoin Ecosystem**: Beyond a meme, SHIB supports DeFi (ShibaSwap), NFTs (Shiboshis), and Shibarium, unlike most memecoins.
- **Massive Community**: Known as the “SHIB Army,” its community drives viral marketing and charitable initiatives (e.g., India COVID relief).
- **Token Burning**: Regular burns (e.g., 1T SHIB burned in 2024) aim to reduce supply and boost scarcity.
- **Shibarium Scalability**: Processes ~1M transactions daily with gas fees under $0.01, competing with Polygon and Arbitrum.

## SHIB Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Shibarium V2 (Q1 2025)**: Improved transaction throughput to 10M daily and added EVM compatibility for dApp growth 
- **ShibaSwap 2.0 (March 2025)**: Enhanced DeFi platform with 20% higher APY for SHIB staking pools.
- **Metaverse Beta (June 2025)**: Launched SHIB: The Metaverse testnet, integrating 10K NFT land plots with SHIB payments.

## How Is SHIB Secured?

SHIB and its ecosystem are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for SHIB token security.
- **Shibarium Security**: Uses BONE for validator staking, with 21 validators securing the layer-2 network.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Audits by CertiK and Hacken ensure ShibaSwap and Shibarium contract integrity.
- **Community Oversight**: Decentralized governance via BONE holders prevents centralized control.

## Conclusion

**Shiba Inu (SHIB)** has grown from a memecoin to a robust Web3 ecosystem with Shibarium, ShibaSwap, and NFT initiatives. With a 589T circulating supply, and 200+ exchange listings, SHIB combines community-driven momentum with DeFi and layer-2 innovation.
