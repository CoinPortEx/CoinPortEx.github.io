# What Is Synthetix (SNX)?

**Synthetix (SNX)**, launched in September 2017 as Havven and rebranded in 2018, [Synthetix](https://www.synthetix.io/) is a decentralized protocol on Ethereum and Optimism for issuing and trading synthetic assets (Synths) that track real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and cryptocurrencies. SNX token holders stake their tokens to provide liquidity and earn rewards. 

## Key Features
- **Synthetic Assets (Synths)**: Synths (e.g., sUSD, sBTC) mirror asset prices without direct ownership, using oracles for real-time data.
- **Decentralized Perps**: Offers perpetual futures with off-chain oracles, powering platforms like Kwenta and Lyra.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates on Ethereum and Optimism, with plans to sunset Base support in 2025.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 260+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Kraken) and integrates with 177+ markets and wallets like MetaMask.

## SNX Token
- **Purpose**: Used for staking, governance, and collateralizing Synths, with stakers earning fees from protocol activity.
- **Supply**: ~343M SNX in circulation, with a maximum supply of 343M (fully diluted as of February 2021).
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, SNX’s contract is `0xc011a73ee8576fb46f5e1c5751ca3b9fe0af2a6f` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/synthetix-network-token) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/synthetix/).

## Who Are the Founders of SNX?

Synthetix was founded by **Kain Warwick**, with key contributions from **Justin Moses** (CTO) and **Jordan Momtazi**. Launched via a $30M ICO in 2017, the project transitioned to a decentralized model on Optimism to reduce gas fees. Backed by investors like Paradigm and Coinbase Ventures, Synthetix is governed by a community DAO.

## What Makes SNX Unique?

Synthetix stands out in Web3:
- **Deep Liquidity**: Provides backend liquidity for DeFi protocols like Kwenta, Lyra, and Polynomial, with ~$54M annualized revenue.
- **Decentralized Derivatives**: Enables permissionless futures and options trading, competing with centralized exchanges.
- **Deflationary Shift**: Ended token inflation in December 2023, adopting a buy-and-burn model.
- **Cross-Chain Synths**: Supports assets across Polygon, Avalanche, and Fantom, though scaling challenges persist.

## SNX Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Perps V3 (Q1 2025)**: Enhanced perpetual futures with lower fees and improved oracle latency.
- **Infinex Launch (March 2025)**: Introduced a decentralized front-end mimicking CEX usability, boosting trading volume by 15%.
- **Ethereum L1 Focus (June 2025)**: Shifted from Base to Ethereum mainnet, closing Base LP vaults to prioritize scalability.

## How Is SNX Secured?

Synthetix and SNX are secured through:
- **Ethereum/Optimism PoS**: Leverages Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin ensure protocol integrity.
- **Staking Collateral**: SNX, ETH, and LUSD collateralize Synths, with over-collateralization protecting against volatility.
- **DAO Governance**: Community-driven decisions via SNX token holders prevent centralized control.

## Conclusion

**Synthetix (SNX)** is a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling synthetic assets and decentralized derivatives. Its liquidity powers protocols like Kwenta and Lyra, while upgrades like Perps V3 and Infinex enhance usability. Despite challenges with multi-chain scaling, Synthetix’s deflationary model and focus on Ethereum position it as a leader in Web3 derivatives, appealing to DeFi innovators and traders.
