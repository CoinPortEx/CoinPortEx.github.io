# Who Are the Founders of Solana?

Solana was co-founded by **Anatoly Yakovenko**, **Raj Gokal**, **Greg Fitzgerald**, and **Stephen Akridge** in 2017, with Solana Labs launching the blockchain in 2020. The Solana Foundation, based in Geneva, Switzerland, supports ecosystem growth. Backed by investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) and Multicoin Capital, Solana raised $25.6M in its initial seed sale.

# What Makes Solana Unique?

Solana stands out for its high-performance blockchain:

- **Proof-of-History (PoH)**: Timestamps transactions to boost throughput, complementing PoS.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Supports Rust, C, and Solang (Solidity-compatible compiler), attracting Ethereum developers.
- **Only Possible on Solana (OPOS)**: Enables unique dApps like Jupiter and Backpack due to speed and low costs.
- **Institutional Adoption**: Praised by Franklin Templeton and Kraken as a leader in on-chain finance, with spot ETF proposals filed.

# SOL Network Upgrades (2025)

- **Firedancer Client (Q1 2025)**: Introduced a second validator client by Jump Crypto, enhancing network resilience and decentralization.
- **QUIC Protocol (March 2025)**: Improved data transfer, boosting TPS and reducing latency for DeFi and gaming dApps.
- **Solana Mobile 2.0 (June 2025)**: Launched the second-generation Saga smartphone, integrating a dApp store and Web3 wallet, driving retail adoption.

# How Is SOL Secured?

Solana and SOL are secured through:

- **PoH + PoS Consensus**: PoH orders transactions, while PoS validators stake SOL to confirm blocks, with slashing for misbehavior.
- **Validator Diversity**: Over 1,900 validators globally, with clients like Jito Labs and Firedancer ensuring resilience.
- **Network Audits**: Regular audits of core protocol and dApps by firms like Halborn mitigate vulnerabilities.
- **Decentralized Governance**: SOL holders vote on protocol upgrades, ensuring community-driven security.

# Conclusion

**Solana (SOL)** powers a leading Layer 1 blockchain, delivering unparalleled speed, scalability, and low costs for DeFi, NFTs, and Web3 applications. With a vibrant ecosystem, institutional backing, and recent upgrades like Firedancer and Solana Mobile 2.0, Solana is poised to drive the future of on-chain finance and internet capital markets in the $3.5T+ crypto economy.
