## Sonic Protocol (S)
## What Is Sonic (S)?
Sonic is a high-performance Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Layer-1 blockchain designed to power the next generation of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Launched as a rebrand of Fantom in 2025 with a 1:1 token swap, Sonic delivers exceptional speed, offering 400,000 transactions per second (TPS) and sub-second finality.
The S token is the native currency of the Sonic network, used for transaction fees, staking, running validators, and participating in governance. Sonic’s Fee Monetization (FeeM) program is a standout feature, rewarding developers with up to 90% of the fees generated by their applications. The protocol also includes the Sonic Gateway, a secure bridge to Ethereum, ensuring seamless access to liquidity with a fail-safe mechanism to protect assets.
Sonic, named for its lightning-fast transaction speeds, targets developers and users in the DeFi and Web3 space, providing a scalable and incentivized ecosystem for building and interacting with decentralized applications.

## Who Are the Founders of Sonic?
Sonic, originally launched as Fantom in 2018, was founded by the Fantom Foundation, with significant contributions from Dr. Ahn Byung Ik and later led by figures like Michael Kong. The rebranding to Sonic in 2025 was driven by the Sonic Labs team and a global community of developers and contributors. The transition aimed to enhance the platform’s focus on high-speed DeFi and Web3 innovation, building on Fantom’s established infrastructure.
The Sonic Labs team targets developers and crypto enthusiasts, aiming to provide a robust platform for scalable DeFi applications while maintaining strong community governance.
