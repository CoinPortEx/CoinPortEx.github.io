# What Is Stacks (STX)?

**Stacks (STX)** is the native cryptocurrency of the Stacks blockchain, a decentralized layer-2 scaling solution for Bitcoin launched in 2018. Built by Blockstack PBC (now Hiro Systems), [Stacks](https://www.stacks.co/) enables smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and decentralized applications (dApps) on Bitcoin’s secure network. Using a Proof-of-Transfer (PoT) consensus mechanism, Stacks leverages Bitcoin’s hash power for security while offering fast transactions and low fees. 

## Key Features
- **Bitcoin Layer-2**: Anchors transactions to Bitcoin, inheriting its security while enabling smart contract functionality via the Clarity language.
- **Proof-of-Transfer (PoT)**: Miners bid BTC to validate transactions, rewarding STX holders who stake (stack) their tokens with BTC payouts.
- **High Throughput**: Processes transactions in ~5 seconds post-Nakamoto upgrade, supporting thousands of TPS.
- **DeFi and NFT Ecosystem**: Hosts dApps like Stacking DAO and markets for Bitcoin-based NFTs and tokenized assets.

## STX Token
- **Purpose**: Powers transaction fees, stacking (staking), governance, and participation in DeFi and NFT markets.
- **Supply**: ~1.5B STX in circulation, with a maximum supply of ~1.8B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Stacks blockchain; compatible with wallets like Leather or Xverse for DeFi and stacking [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stacks/).


## Who Are the Founders of Stacks?
Stacks was co-founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea under Blockstack PBC, with Ali leading as CEO. The project raised $52M through a 2017 token sale, the first SEC-regulated offering in crypto. Supported by investors like Tim Draper and Union Square Ventures, Stacks transitioned to a decentralized network with the Nakamoto upgrade in 2024.

## What Makes Stacks Unique?
Stacks stands out in the blockchain ecosystem:
- **Bitcoin Integration**: Expands Bitcoin’s utility beyond a store of value, enabling DeFi, NFTs, and dApps without altering Bitcoin’s protocol.
- **Clarity Language**: Offers a secure, predictable smart contract language, reducing vulnerabilities compared to Solidity.
- **sBTC Asset**: Introduces a decentralized, Bitcoin-backed asset for DeFi, with 100% Bitcoin hash-power security.
- **SEC Regulation**: First crypto project with an SEC-regulated token offering, enhancing institutional trust.

## Stacks Network Upgrades (2025)
- **SIP-031 Emission Schedule (June 2025)**: Passed with majority support, introducing incentives to boost ecosystem growth and market adoption.
- **sBTC Mainnet Expansion (March 2025)**: Scaled sBTC for broader DeFi use, enabling tokenized Bitcoin in Stacks dApps.
- **WASM Integration (May 2025)**: Added WebAssembly support, expanding developer access to Rust-based dApps.
- **Stacking DAO Enhancements (July 2025)**: Improved staking rewards and governance, increasing BTC payouts for STX stakers.

## How Is Stacks Secured?

- **Proof-of-Transfer (PoT)**: Ties Stacks’ consensus to Bitcoin’s hash power, ensuring unparalleled security.
- **Bitcoin Anchoring**: Finalizes transactions on Bitcoin’s blockchain, leveraging its immutability.
- **Clarity Contracts**: Minimizes bugs and exploits through predictable smart contract execution.


## Conclusion
**Stacks (STX)** is a transformative layer-2 blockchain unlocking smart contracts and DeFi on Bitcoin’s secure network. With backing from Tim Draper and Union Square Ventures, Stacks’ 2025 upgrades like SIP-031 and sBTC expansion position it as a leader in Bitcoin-based Web3 innovation.
