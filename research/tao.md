# What Is Bittensor (TAO)?

**Bittensor (TAO)**, launched in March 2023, is the native token of the [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com/) Layer 1 (L1) blockchain, an open-source protocol creating a decentralized machine learning network. Bittensor enables collaborative AI model training, rewarding participants with TAO based on their contributions’ informational value. Its subnet architecture supports specialized AI tasks, fostering a trustless market for artificial intelligence. TAO powers governance, staking, and access to the network’s AI resources, with a $2.7 billion total value locked (TVL).

## Key Features
- **Decentralized AI**: Connects AI models globally, rewarding miners and validators for training and evaluating models.
- **Subnets**: 66+ active subnets host specialized AI tasks, from language models to image generation, with validators allocating TAO rewards.
- **High Scalability**: Processes ~10,000 transactions per second (TPS) with low latency, optimized for AI workloads.
- **Ecosystem**: Includes tokens like NEURALAI, tao.bot, and PURR, with subnets listed on CoinGecko’s Bittensor Ecosystem category.

## TAO Token
- **Purpose**: Used for staking, governance, rewarding AI contributions, and accessing network data.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~8.8 million TAO, with a max supply of 21 million.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Bittensor L1,  [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bittensor)  [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bittensor/) 



# Who Are the Founders of Bittensor?

Bittensor was co-founded by **Jacob Steeves** and **Ala Shaabana** under **Opentensor Foundation**.
