The Tectum Enumeration Token (TET) provides partners with a universal and highly lucrative entry system into the suite of Financial Technology (FINTECH) tools.

## What Is TET?

## Who Are the Founders of TET?

## What Makes TET Unique?
Tectum is a Blockchain network that employs proprietary Proof-of-Utility (PoU) Consensus and super-fast Network Protocol as described in the Tectum White Paper. PoU protocol optimizes data distribution, and the Network Protocol enables nodes to distribute and validate over 1 Million digital events per second, making Tectum the fastest Blockchain in the world by far. To put this into perspective, Bitcoin processes from 4.6 to 7 Transactions Per Second (TPS), Ethereum from 12 to 25 TPS, Cardano 250 TPS, and Solana 29,000 TPS. Tectum is not only the fastest blockchain in the world, but also the most secure and the most adaptable, reaching speeds of 1.38 Million TPS during peak performance.
A SoftNote is the flagship product of Tectum and is positioned as the first “Transactionless” Payment System boasting truly instant payment capabilities and a zero-fee policy for the end user.
