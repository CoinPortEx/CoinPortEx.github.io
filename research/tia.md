# What Is Celestia (TIA)?

**Celestia (TIA)** is the native cryptocurrency of Celestia, the first modular layer-1 blockchain launched on October 31, 2023. Built with the Cosmos SDK, Celestia specializes in data availability (DA), decoupling consensus, execution, and settlement to enable scalable rollup-based ecosystems. By providing a dedicated DA layer, [Celestia](https://celestia.org/) allows developers to deploy custom blockchains with minimal overhead, enhancing flexibility and scalability for Web3 applications. 

## Key Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Separates data availability from execution and settlement, enabling rollups to focus on transaction processing.
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS)**: Uses a PoS consensus with data availability sampling, ensuring efficient and verifiable data access.
- **High Scalability**: Supports thousands of rollups with low-cost DA, achieving near-instant finality (<2 seconds).
- **Developer-Friendly**: Compatible with multiple programming languages and rollup frameworks, fostering innovation.

## TIA Token
- **Purpose**: Facilitates gas fees, staking, governance, and airdrop rewards within the Celestia ecosystem.
- **Supply**: ~700M TIA in circulation, with a maximum supply of ~1.1B. 
- **Contract Address**: Native to Celestia blockchain; compatible with wallets like Keplr or Leap Cosmos for DeFi and staking [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/celestia) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/celestia/).


## Who Are the Founders of Celestia?
Celestia was founded by Mustafa Al-Bassam, Ismail Khoffi, and John Adler, with Al-Bassam leading as CEO. The Celestia Foundation raised $155M, including a $100M round in 2024 led by Bain Capital Crypto, with support from Polychain Capital, Coinbase Ventures, and Binance Labs. The mainnet launched in October 2023, marking a milestone in modular blockchain development.

## What Makes Celestia Unique?

- **First Modular DA Layer**: Pioneers data availability separation, enabling rollups to scale without execution bottlenecks.
- **Airdrop Ecosystem**: TIA stakers benefit from airdrops (e.g., Dymension snapshot), incentivizing participation.
- **Strong Backing**: Supported by major investors like Bain Capital Crypto and Galaxy Digital ($27M net position, $41M locked tokens).
- **Rollup-as-a-Service**: Simplifies blockchain deployment, powering projects like Caldera and Manta Pacific.

## Celestia Network Upgrades (2024–2025)
- **Solana-Level Finality (2024)**: Achieved high-throughput DA with <2-second finality, rivaling Solana’s performance.
- **Content-Addressable Mempool (2025)**: Enhanced transaction efficiency for rollups, reducing costs.


## How Is Celestia Secured?

- **PoS with Data Sampling**: Validators stake TIA and use data availability sampling to ensure data integrity.
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community-driven via TIA staking, with 16% APY for delegators.
- **Rollup Security**: Inherits security from validator set, enabling secure, sovereign rollups.


## Conclusion
**Celestia (TIA)** is a pioneering modular blockchain redefining scalability through data availability separation. With a strong investor backing, Celestia drives rollup-based ecosystems for Web3. Its 2025 upgrades, including stablecoin integration and gas-free transactions, position it as a leader in modular blockchain innovation.
