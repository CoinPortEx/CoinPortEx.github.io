# What Is TRON (TRX)?

**TRON (TRX)**, launched in September 2017, is a decentralized, layer-1 blockchain platform designed to advance internet decentralization through smart contracts and high-throughput infrastructure. Initially an ERC-20 token on Ethereum, [TRON](https://tron.network/) migrated to its own blockchain in 2018. Its native token, **TRX**, powers transactions, staking, and governance. 

## Key Features
- **High Throughput**: Processes up to 2,000 TPS, surpassing Ethereum (~25 TPS), with low-cost transactions (~$0.0001).
- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**: 27 Super Representatives, elected by TRX stakers, validate blocks for efficiency.
- **Content Ecosystem**: Enables creators to monetize content directly, bypassing intermediaries like YouTube.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports 145+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, HTX), 341+ markets, and wallets like TronLink and Trust Wallet.

## TRX Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking for Tron Power (voting rights), and content payments.
- **Supply**: ~94.8B TRX in circulation, with a total supply of 100B (10B burned since 2021).
- **Contract Address**: Native to TRON;  [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tron/).

## Who Are the Founders of TRX?

TRON was founded by **Justin Sun**, a controversial figure known for his roles at BitTorrent and Poloniex. Launched via a $70M ICO in 2017, TRON allocated 45% of TRX to Sun and the Tron Foundation, sparking centralization critiques. The project is now community-governed via DPoS, with Sun maintaining influence.

## What Makes TRX Unique?

TRON stands out in Web3:
- **Content Monetization**: Enables direct creator-to-consumer payments, challenging centralized platforms like YouTube.
- **Meme Coin Hub**: Hosts top memecoins like Sundog and Tron Bull, with $80.2M in meme market cap.
- **Deflationary Mechanism**: Over 10B TRX burned since 2021, reducing supply to boost scarcity
- **Scalability**: High TPS and low fees make TRON ideal for DeFi and dApps, with ~1.7M daily transactions.

## TRX Network Upgrades (2025)
- **TRX Reduction Proposal (June 2025)**: Reduced block rewards from 16 to 8 TRX and voting rewards from 160 to 128 TRX, enhancing scarcity.
- **Energy Cap Increase (Q2 2025)**: Raised daily energy cap from 120B to 150B, lowering network fees.
- **SunPump Expansion (April 2025)**: Boosted memecoin launches, increasing TRONâ€™s DeFi TVL by 10%.

## How Is TRX Secured?

TRON and TRX are secured through:
- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**: 27 elected Super Representatives validate transactions, with TRX stakers voting for governance.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like SlowMist ensure protocol integrity.
- **Burn Mechanism**: Periodic TRX burns reduce supply, enhancing economic security.
- **Network Monitoring**: Community-driven oversight and high hashrate protect against attacks.

## Conclusion

**TRON (TRX)** is a leading layer-1 blockchain, emphasizing decentralization, high scalability, and creator empowerment. With 94.8B circulating supply, and a robust ecosystem across 145+ exchanges, TRON supports DeFi, memecoins, and content monetization. Its DPoS model, low-cost transactions, and 2025 upgrades like TRX reduction position it as a Web3 powerhouse, though centralization concerns linger.
