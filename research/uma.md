# What Is UMA (UMA)?

**UMA (UMA)**, launched in May 2020, is a decentralized protocol on Ethereum for creating and managing synthetic assets and financial contracts using its optimistic oracle system. [UMA](https://uma.xyz/) (Universal Market Access) enables anyone to design trustless derivatives, such as tokenized indices or prediction markets, without intermediaries. Its native token, **UMA**, powers governance and oracle dispute resolution. 

## Key Features
- **Optimistic Oracle**: Provides flexible, human-powered data verification for smart contracts, securing ~$75B in DeFi value across applications like cross-chain bridges and insurance protocols.
- **Synthetic Assets**: Enables creation of Synths tracking assets like stocks, crypto, or commodities without direct ownership.
- **Decentralized Governance**: UMA token holders vote on protocol upgrades and resolve oracle disputes.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 69+ exchanges (e.g., HTX, Binance) and 87+ markets, with wallet support like MetaMask.

## UMA Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking in oracle disputes, and incentivizing accurate data reporting.
- **Supply**: ~88M UMA in circulation, with a maximum supply of 130M.
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, UMA’s contract is `0x04fa0d235c4abf4bcf4787af4cf447de572ef828` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uma) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uma/).

## Who Are the Founders of UMA?

UMA was co-founded by **Hart Lambur** and **Allison Lu**, former Goldman Sachs traders, in 2018. Backed by investors like Blockchain Capital and Coinbase Ventures, UMA aims to democratize financial markets. The project transitioned to community governance via a DAO, with no centralized control.

## What Makes UMA Unique?

UMA stands out in Web3:
- **Optimistic Oracle Design**: Uses a “true unless disputed” model, allowing flexible data inputs with human verification, unlike price-feed oracles.
- **Permissionless Derivatives**: Anyone can create financial contracts, expanding DeFi’s design space for DAOs, prediction markets, and insurance.
- **Cross-Chain Utility**: Secures applications like Across Protocol’s bridge and Outcome’s DAO tooling, enhancing interoperability.
- **Audited Security**: Contracts audited by OpenZeppelin ensure robustness across UMA’s ecosystem.

## UMA Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Across V2 Bridge (Q1 2025)**: Improved cross-chain transfers with UMA’s oracle, securing $500M+ in bridged assets 
- **Optimistic Governor V3 (March 2025)**: Enhanced DAO tooling for customizable governance, adopted by 10+ protocols.
- **Outcome Finance Expansion (June 2025)**: Launched new synthetic indices, increasing UMA’s DeFi TVL by 12%.

## How Is UMA Secured?

UMA and its token are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Optimistic Oracle**: Disputes resolved by UMA token holders, ensuring data integrity with economic incentives.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by OpenZeppelin and others protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Governance Staking**: UMA holders stake tokens to participate in dispute resolution, aligning incentives.

## Conclusion

**UMA (UMA)** is a pivotal DeFi protocol, enabling synthetic assets and financial contracts through its optimistic oracle. With a 88M circulating supply, and integration across 69+ exchanges, UMA powers cross-chain bridges, DAOs, and prediction markets. Its permissionless design, audited contracts, and 2025 upgrades like Across V2 position UMA as a leader in decentralized finance, though its complexity may limit mainstream adoption.
