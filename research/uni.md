# What Is Uniswap (UNI)?

**Uniswap (UNI)**, launched in November 2018, is a decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol on Ethereum, enabling permissionless token swaps and liquidity provision through automated market makers (AMMs). Governed by [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/) DAO, it’s a cornerstone of DeFi with ~$7.1B in total value locked (TVL). Its native token, **UNI**, facilitates governance and fee distribution. 

## Key Features
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Uses liquidity pools for token swaps, eliminating order books, with ~$1.5T in lifetime trading volume.
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Operates on Ethereum, Optimism, Arbitrum, Polygon, and others, with low-cost transactions on Layer-2s.
- **Liquidity Provision**: Users provide liquidity to earn fees (~0.05%-1%), with over 1M liquidity providers.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 300+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and integrates with wallets like MetaMask and Trust Wallet.

## UNI Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance voting, fee sharing, and community incentives.
- **Supply**: ~600M UNI in circulation, with a maximum supply of 1B (fully vested by 2024).
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, UNI’s contract is `0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/uniswap/).

## Who Are the Founders of UNI?

Uniswap was founded by **Hayden Adams**, a former Siemens engineer, inspired by Ethereum’s Vitalik Buterin. Launched with a $100K grant from the Ethereum Foundation, Uniswap Labs raised $165M in 2022 from a16z and Paradigm. The Uniswap DAO, governed by UNI holders, now drives development.

## What Makes UNI Unique?

Uniswap stands out in Web3:
- **Permissionless Trading**: Anyone can list or trade tokens without intermediaries, supporting thousands of ERC-20 tokens.
- **Fee Switch Potential**: UNI holders can vote to distribute protocol fees, potentially rewarding stakers.
- **V4 Innovation**: Uniswap V4’s hooks and singleton architecture reduce gas costs by 99% compared to V2.
- **DeFi Dominance**: Powers 60%+ of Ethereum DEX volume, with integrations in Aave, Compound, and others.

## UNI Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Uniswap V4 (Q1 2025)**: Launched customizable pools with hooks, improving capital efficiency and reducing fees.
- **Layer-2 Expansion (March 2025)**: Added Base and Scroll support, boosting transaction throughput by 20%.
- **Fee Switch Proposal (June 2025)**: Community vote enabled 0.25% fee distribution to UNI stakers, increasing staking by 15%.

## How Is UNI Secured?

Uniswap and UNI are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by Trail of Bits and OpenZeppelin ensure protocol integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: UNI holders vote on upgrades, preventing centralized control.
- **Liquidity Pool Security**: Non-custodial pools and immutable contracts reduce risks of hacks.

## Conclusion

**Uniswap (UNI)** is a leading DeFi protocol, revolutionizing token swaps with its AMM model and $7.1B TVL. With a 600M circulating supply, and 300+ exchange listings, Uniswap drives Web3’s decentralized trading. Its V4 upgrade, Layer-2 scalability, and potential fee distribution solidify its dominance, though high Ethereum gas fees remain a challenge for non-L2 users.
