### Vaulta Protocol (A)
## What Is Vaulta (A)?
Vaulta is a Web3 banking network designed to power the next generation of decentralized financial services. Built on a highly reliable Layer 1 blockchain, Vaulta enables secure, scalable, and composable financial applications, including wealth management, consumer payments, investment access, and insurance.
Vaulta, originally launched as EOS in 2018, rebranded to Vaulta (A) in 2025 with a 1:1 token swap ratio, reflecting its new focus on Web3 banking. The A token serves as the native currency of the Vaulta network, used for transaction fees, governance, and accessing financial services. Token holders can vote for Block Producers, who maintain the network and influence protocol upgrades.
The name Vaulta, evoking "vault" for security and "a" for alpha, symbolizes a secure, forward-looking approach to finance. The protocol aims to bridge traditional banking with decentralized digital assets, offering services like high-yield crypto accounts and real-world asset tokenization.

## Who Are the Founders of Vaulta?
Vaulta, as a rebrand of EOS, was originally founded by Block.one, with key contributions from figures like Daniel Larimer, a prominent blockchain innovator. The rebranding to Vaulta was driven by a global network of contributors, including the Vaulta Foundation, Vaulta Labs, Vaulta Middleware (Greymass), and Vaulta Ventures. This decentralized community of developers, Block Producers, and stakeholders collaborates to advance Vaulta’s mission of creating a Web3 banking ecosystem.
The Vaulta Foundation and its community aim to serve institutions and consumers already engaged in the cryptocurrency and Web3 space, providing tools for seamless integration of decentralized finance with traditional systems.

## What Makes Vaulta Unique?
Vaulta stands out in the competitive blockchain and DeFi landscape due to its robust infrastructure and focus on Web3 banking. During its launch in 2025, it gained attention for its high transaction throughput and institutional-grade reliability, with over 2,600 consecutive days of uptime.
The protocol uses a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism combined with the Savanna consensus algorithm, enabling one-second transaction finality. This makes Vaulta ideal for real-time financial applications. Key features include:
<ul>
  <li>Support for tokenized real-world assets (e.g., real estate via partners like Spirit Blockchain) and Bitcoin-native yield through integration with exSat.</li>
  <li>Developer tools like WharfKit (a modular SDK) and Unicove Portal for managing accounts and smart contracts, supporting Solidity and C++ for flexible app development.</li>
  <li>A decentralized governance model where A token holders elect Block Producers to maintain infrastructure and guide protocol decisions.</li>
</ul>
Vaulta’s ecosystem is expanding through strategic partnerships, such as with Fosun for Hong Kong’s FinChain, positioning it as a backbone for tokenized banking and Web3 finance.
