# What Is Worldcoin (WLD)?

**Worldcoin (WLD)**, launched in July 2023, is the governance token of the [Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/) protocol, a blockchain-based platform built on Ethereum and Optimism to create a global identity and financial network. Using World ID, a privacy-preserving “Proof of Personhood” verified by iris-scanning Orbs, Worldcoin enables users to prove their humanity online while maintaining anonymity via zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). WLD powers governance, incentives, and access to the network, with a $2.1 billion market cap and U.S. availability since June 2025.

## Key Features
- **World ID**: A decentralized identifier (DID) for anonymous human verification, integrated with platforms like Coinbase and Binance.
- **Orb Verification**: Physical devices scan irises to create unique, privacy-protected World IDs, with 12M+ verified users.
- **Universal Access**: Aims to distribute WLD grants to verified humans globally (excluding the U.S. for regulatory reasons).
- **Ecosystem**: Supports financial transactions, DeFi, and identity verification, with partnerships like KAIST for privacy tech.

## WLD Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, and claiming recurring grants for Orb-verified users (outside the U.S.).
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~1.6 billion WLD, with a max supply of 10 billion.
- **Contract Address**: `0x163f8c2467924be0ae7b5347228cabf260318753` (Ethereum, addable to MetaMask), [coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/worldcoin) [cmc](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/worldcoin-org/).



# Who Are the Founders of Worldcoin?

Worldcoin was co-founded by **Sam Altman** (OpenAI CEO), **Alex Blania**, and **Max Novendstern** (left in 2021), with initial R&D by **Tools for Humanity (TFH)**. Backed by $250M+ from investors like Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Blockchain Capital, and Tiger Global, the team aims to scale World ID to a billion users for global economic inclusion.

# What Makes Worldcoin Unique?

WLD and Worldcoin stand out for their identity-focused mission:

- **Proof of Personhood**: World ID uses ZKPs to verify human uniqueness without storing personal data, addressing bot and Sybil attacks.
- **Orb Technology**: Iris-scanning Orbs ensure secure, private identity verification, with 12M+ users across 100+ countries.
- **Governance Innovation**: Supports “one-person-one-vote” mechanisms, combining World ID with WLD for equitable decision-making.
- **Global Distribution**: Plans to distribute most WLD tokens to verified humans, potentially becoming the most widely held crypto.

Worldcoin’s privacy tech, like Anonymized Multi-Party Computation (AMPC) with KAIST, enhances its DeFi and identity appeal.

# WLD Network Upgrades (2025)

- **U.S. Launch (June 2025)**: Worldcoin became available in the U.S., expanding Orb verification and app adoption.
- **AMPC Partnership**: Collaborated with KAIST to bolster privacy via advanced cryptographic techniques.
- **Coinbase Listing**: WLD listed on Coinbase, driving a 17.5% trading volume spike to $238M in 24 hours.




# How Is WLD Secured?

WLD and the Worldcoin protocol are secured through:

- **Ethereum/Optimism PoS**: Leverages proof-of-stake security for transaction integrity.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Ensures privacy by separating iris data from World ID actions.
- **Worldcoin Foundation**: Governs protocol upgrades with ARB holder input.
- **Orb Security**: Employs cryptographic safeguards to protect biometric data.


# Conclusion

**Worldcoin (WLD)** powers a global identity and financial network, using World ID and Orbs to verify human uniqueness with privacy. Its governance model, U.S. launch, and OpenAI ties position it as a DeFi and identity leader.
