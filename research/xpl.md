# What Is Plasma (XPL)?

**Plasma (XPL)** is a high-performance, EVM-compatible Layer-1 blockchain designed specifically for stablecoins, enabling near-instant, fee-free transfers of digital dollars like USD₮ at global scale. Launched in 2025, Plasma addresses the unique demands of the $250B+ stablecoin market by offering zero-fee USD₮ payments, custom gas tokens, confidential transactions, and high throughput for applications in payments, remittances, and DeFi. Backed by Bitfinex and Tether, it combines Bitcoin's security with Ethereum's flexibility to create a programmable infrastructure for the stablecoin economy. Plasma also powers **Plasma One**, a neobank and card solution that integrates saving, spending, and earning functionalities into a single app and card, making global financial services universally accessible.

## Key Features
- **Zero-Fee Stablecoin Transfers**: Enables gasless USD₮ transactions via authorization-based systems, ideal for P2P payments and remittances without additional wallet balances.
- **EVM Compatibility**: Full support for Ethereum tools, smart contracts, and dApps, allowing seamless developer migration and integration.
- **Custom Gas Tokens**: Users can pay transaction fees in stablecoins instead of native tokens, enhancing usability for stablecoin-focused applications.
- **Confidential Payments**: Privacy-preserving transactions compliant with regulatory standards, supporting secure, verifiable transfers.
- **High Throughput and Low Latency**: PlasmaBFT consensus processes thousands of transactions per second with sub-second finality, optimized for global-scale stablecoin adoption.
- **Plasma One Integration**: Powers the Plasma One app and card, offering 10%+ yield on savings, 4% cashback on spending, and borderless coverage across 150+ countries, all built on Plasma's infrastructure.

## XPL Token
- **Purpose**: Acts as the native asset for securing the Proof-of-Stake network through staking and validation, paying transaction fees (when not using custom gas), participating in governance, and incentivizing ecosystem growth via rewards for validators and builders. XPL also underpins the security and scalability of Plasma One's operations.
- **Supply**: ~1.8B XPL in circulation (as of September 2025), with a total and maximum supply of 10B (fixed, with emissions distributed to stakers and base fees burned via EIP-1559 model for deflationary pressure).
- **Contract Address**: Native to Plasma blockchain; compatible with EVM wallets like MetaMask. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/plasma) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/plasma-xpl/).

## Who Are the Founders of Plasma?
Plasma was founded in 2023 by a team of experts in blockchain, finance, and distributed systems, with backgrounds from Apple, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Imperial College London, and Los Alamos National Lab. The core team includes veterans from building major stablecoins and blockchains, emphasizing institutional-grade security and scalability. Operating under the Plasma Foundation, the project raised $20M in Series A funding from Framework Ventures, Bitfinex, Bybit, Flow Traders, IMC, and 6th Man Ventures, focusing on community-aligned development without a traditional ICO.

## What Makes Plasma Unique?
Plasma differentiates in the Layer-1 space:
- **Stablecoin-Native Design**: Built exclusively for stablecoins from the ground up, unlike general-purpose chains, with features like zero-fee USD₮ transfers and custom gas to eliminate friction in value transfers.
- **Bitcoin-Secured Sidechain**: Leverages Bitcoin's robustness for bridge security and cross-chain liquidity, while maintaining EVM compatibility for developer accessibility.
- **Institutional Backing and Compliance**: Supported by Tether/Bitfinex, it prioritizes regulatory-compliant privacy and transparency, bridging traditional finance with DeFi for global remittances and merchant adoption.
- **Economic Alignment**: XPL secures the network like central bank reserves, with fair token distribution (e.g., to community contributors) and burns to align incentives for long-term stablecoin growth.
- **Programmable Money Rails**: Enables composability for payments, FX, card rails, and on/off-ramps, fostering an open ecosystem for digital dollar innovation, including the Plasma One app and card.

## Plasma Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Mainnet Beta Launch (September 25, 2025)**: Introduced PlasmaBFT consensus and Reth execution layer for high-speed, EVM-compatible operations, enabling initial zero-fee USD₮ transfers via dashboard and supporting Plasma One's rollout.
- **XPL Token Generation Event (September 25, 2025)**: Deployed native token with broad distribution, including 25M XPL to verified depositors and 2.5M to the Stablecoin Collective for education and adoption, aligning with Plasma One's user base growth.
- **Community and Ecosystem Allocations (Q3 2025)**: Rolled out incentives for validators, builders, and contributors, with jurisdictional-compliant distributions to support global participation, including Plasma One's expansion.
- **Bridge and Liquidity Enhancements (H2 2025)**: Added Bitcoin bridge for cross-chain stablecoin-BTC routing and liquidity incentives to boost interoperability, benefiting Plasma One's borderless features.
- **Developer Tools Expansion (Ongoing 2025)**: Released SDKs, RPC endpoints, and testnet faucets for building stablecoin dApps, emphasizing low-latency integrations that power Plasma One's functionality.

## How Is Plasma Secured?
- **Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Consensus**: XPL staking secures validators, with slashing mechanisms to deter malicious behavior and emissions rewarding honest participation, ensuring the reliability of Plasma One's operations.
- **PlasmaBFT and Reth Layers**: High-speed Byzantine Fault Tolerance combined with audited EVM execution ensures fast finality and resistance to attacks, critical for Plasma One's real-time financial services.
- **Bitcoin Bridge Security**: Leverages Bitcoin's mainnet for cross-chain transfers, providing robust collateralization and verifiability, enhancing Plasma One's trust in global transactions.
- **Audits and Transparency**: Multi-layer smart contract audits, EIP-1559 fee burning for economic stability, and open-source code promote trust; confidential transactions use zero-knowledge proofs for privacy without compromising compliance, supporting Plasma One's user privacy.

## Conclusion
**Plasma (XPL)** is a purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain revolutionizing stablecoin infrastructure with fee-free, scalable payments and institutional security. Its 2025 mainnet beta and XPL launch, alongside the introduction of **Plasma One**, mark a pivotal step toward trillions in on-chain value transfer, empowering global remittances, merchant adoption, and DeFi innovation. By offering a neobank and card solution that eliminates fees and borders, Plasma One leverages Plasma's innovative infrastructure to redefine how people interact with digital dollars, making financial services more accessible, efficient, and inclusive on a global scale.
