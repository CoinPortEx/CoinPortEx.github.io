# What Is XRP?

**XRP**, launched in 2012, is the native cryptocurrency of the **XRP Ledger (XRPL)**, an open-source, permissionless Layer 1 blockchain designed for fast, low-cost global payments. Developed by Ripple, XRP facilitates cross-border transactions, remittances, and asset tokenization, connecting banks, payment providers, and digital asset exchanges via [RippleNet](https://ripple.com/solutions/cross-border-payments/). XRP powers transaction fees, staking, and decentralized exchange (DEX) operations on the XRPL.

## Key Features
- **Fast Transactions**: Settles payments in 3-5 seconds with a capacity of 1,500 transactions per second (TPS).
- **Low-Cost**: Transaction fees average ~$0.0002, significantly cheaper than traditional remittance systems.
- **Decentralized Exchange**: XRPL’s built-in DEX enables peer-to-peer trading and custom tokenization.
- **Ecosystem**: Supports payments, DeFi, NFTs, central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), and stablecoins like RLUSD.

## XRP Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, and liquidity provision on the XRPL.
- **Supply**: Circulating supply of ~58.9 billion XRP, with a max supply of 100 billion (pre-mined).
- **Contract Address**: Native to XRPL; can be wrapped as an ERC-20 token (e.g., WXRP) on Ethereum for DeFi use. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp)  [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/).

# Who Are the Founders of XRP?

XRP and the XRP Ledger were co-founded by **David Schwartz**, **Jed McCaleb**, and **Arthur Britto** in 2012. Ripple, a fintech company, was gifted 80 billion XRP to develop use cases like RippleNet. The XRP Ledger is maintained by a decentralized community, with Ripple as a key contributor.

# What Makes XRP Unique?

XRP and the XRP Ledger stand out for their payment-focused blockchain:

- **Global Payments**: Designed for cross-border remittances, XRP acts as a bridge currency, reducing costs and settlement times compared to traditional systems.
- **ISO 20022 Compliance**: Aligns with global financial standards, enabling adoption by banks and institutions.
- **Scalability**: Handles high transaction throughput with carbon-neutral, energy-efficient operations.
- **Growing Adoption**: Used by financial institutions globally, with recent regulatory clarity (e.g., SEC case resolution) boosting institutional interest, including ETF proposals.

# XRP Network Upgrades (2025)

- **RLUSD Stablecoin (March 2025)**: Ripple launched RLUSD, a USD-backed stablecoin on XRPL and Ethereum, approved by NYDFS and DFSA, enhancing DeFi and payment use cases.
- **Smart Contract Integration (Q2 2025)**: XRPL introduced Hooks, enabling programmable smart contracts to support complex DeFi and tokenization applications.
- **ETF Developments (June 2025)**: Spot XRP ETF proposals, like Purpose Investment’s in Canada, gained traction, signaling institutional growth.

# How Is XRP Secured?

XRP and the XRP Ledger are secured through:

- **Ripple Protocol Consensus Algorithm (RPCA)**: Transactions are validated by a supermajority of trusted nodes, not Proof-of-Work, ensuring efficiency and decentralization.
- **Decentralized Validators**: Over 150 validator nodes globally, with no single entity controlling the network.
- **Immutable Ledger**: Transactions are recorded on a public, tamper-resistant distributed ledger.
- **Audits**: Regular security audits of XRPL’s codebase ensure robustness and safety.

# Conclusion

**XRP** powers the XRP Ledger, a pioneering blockchain for fast, low-cost global payments and asset tokenization. With its energy-efficient consensus, institutional adoption, and recent advancements like RLUSD and ETF proposals, XRP is positioned as a leader in cross-border finance and DeFi. Its scalability, regulatory clarity, and developer-friendly ecosystem make it a key player in the $1T+ global remittance market.
