- **Governance**: YFI holders vote on protocol upgrades, fee structures, and strategy deployments.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 89+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) and 120+ markets, with wallet support like MetaMask.

## YFI Token
- **Purpose**: Used for governance, staking, and earning protocol fees.
- **Supply**: ~34K YFI in circulation, with a maximum supply of 36.67K (fixed supply, no premine).
- **Contract Address**: On Ethereum, YFI’s contract is `0x0bc529c00c6401aef6d220be8c6ea1667f6ad93e` (addable to MetaMask) [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/nl/coins/yearn-finance) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/yearn-finance/).

## Who Are the Founders of YFI?

Yearn.finance was created by **Andre Cronje**, a prominent DeFi developer also involved with Fantom. Launched without an ICO or premine, YFI was distributed via a fair yield farming event, allocating 30K tokens to early users. The project is now governed by a DAO, with Cronje stepping back from active development in 2022.

## What Makes YFI Unique?

Yearn.finance stands out in Web3:
- **Automated Yield Farming**: Vaults simplify DeFi by optimizing returns without user expertise, unlike manual yield farming.
- **Fair Launch**: No premine or developer allocation, making YFI a community-driven token.
- **yCRV System**: Tokenizes veCRV positions (e.g., st-yCRV, lp-yCRV) to earn Curve fees and bribes, enhancing yield.
- **Resilient Governance**: Over 50 governance proposals passed since 2020, ensuring adaptability.

## YFI Network Upgrades (2025)
- **yCRV V2 (Q1 2025)**: Improved Curve integration, boosting st-yCRV yields by 10%.
- **Layer-2 Expansion (April 2025)**: Enhanced Optimism and Arbitrum Vaults, reducing gas costs by 20%.

## How Is YFI Secured?

Yearn.finance and YFI are secured through:
- **Ethereum PoS**: Leverages Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake for transaction and contract security.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Regular audits by firms like Trail of Bits ensure Vault and governance contract integrity.
- **DAO Governance**: YFI holders vote on upgrades, preventing centralized control.
- **Transparency**: Cronje emphasized inherent DeFi risks, with open-source code audited pre-launch.
