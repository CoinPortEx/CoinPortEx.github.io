# What Is Zcash (ZEC)?

**Zcash (ZEC)**, launched in October 2016, is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency built on a fork of Bitcoin’s codebase, utilizing zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) to enable optional anonymity. [Zcash](https://z.cash/) balances privacy and transparency, allowing users to choose between shielded (private) or transparent transactions. The native token, **ZEC**, powers the network and trades on exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and KuCoin.

## Key Features
- **Optional Privacy**: zk-SNARKs enable shielded transactions that hide sender, receiver, and amount, while transparent transactions resemble Bitcoin’s model.
- **Fungibility**: Shielded ZEC ensures interchangeability, reducing risks of blacklisting due to transaction history.
- **Proof-of-Work Mining**: Uses the Equihash algorithm, designed to be ASIC-resistant, though some ASIC mining occurs.


## ZEC Token
- **Purpose**: Facilitates transactions, mining rewards, and network consensus.
- **Supply**: ~16.7M ZEC in circulation, with a maximum supply of 21M, similar to Bitcoin.
- **Contract**: Operates on its own blockchain, not as an ERC-20 token. Add to wallets like Zashi or Ledger. [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zcash) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zcash/).

## Who Are the Founders of Zcash?
Zcash was founded by Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, a cryptographer with over 25 years in security, previously involved in DigiCash and Mojo Nation. The Electronic Coin Company (ECC), led by Wilcox, manages development, alongside the Zcash Foundation. No premine occurred, but a founders’ reward (20% of block subsidies until 2020) supported early development.

## What Makes Zcash Unique?
Zcash distinguishes itself in the crypto ecosystem:
- **Selective Transparency**: Unlike Monero’s mandatory privacy, Zcash’s optional shielding allows compliance with regulatory needs while offering anonymity.
- **zk-SNARKs Innovation**: Zero-knowledge proofs provide robust privacy without revealing transaction details, a pioneering feature in 2016.
- **Cross-Chain Integration**: Partnerships like Maya Protocol enable decentralized swaps, enhancing user sovereignty.
- **Merchant Adoption**: Spendable via Flexa and Visa cards, with growing real-world use cases.

## Zcash Network Upgrades (2024–2025)
- **Halo 2 (Ongoing)**: Improved zk-SNARK efficiency, enhancing privacy and usability for shielded transactions.
- **Tachyon Architecture (2025)**: Scales private payments, targeting billions of transactions with low fees.
- **Second Halving (November 2024)**: Reduced block subsidy to 1.5625 ZEC, lowering inflation below 5%.
- **Zashi Wallet (2025)**: User-friendly wallet with default privacy and DEX support, boosting adoption.

## How Is Zcash Secured?
Zcash’s security is robust:
- **zk-SNARKs Cryptography**: Ensures private transactions are verifiable without exposing details.
- **Equihash PoW**: Promotes decentralized mining, though ASIC resistance is partially compromised.
- **Decentralized Network**: Global nodes and miners prevent single points of failure.
- **Dev Fund**: 20% of block rewards (post-2020) fund development and security via ECC and Zcash Foundation.

## Conclusion
**Zcash (ZEC)** is a leading privacy coin with a ~16.7M circulating supply. Its optional anonymity, zk-SNARKs innovation, and 2025 upgrades like Tachyon and Zashi position it as a versatile Web3 privacy solution. Despite regulatory challenges, Zcash’s integrations and merchant adoption solidify its role in private digital finance.
