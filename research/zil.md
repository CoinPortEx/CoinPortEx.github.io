# What Is Zilliqa (ZIL)?

**Zilliqa (ZIL)**, launched in January 2018, is a layer-1 blockchain designed for high-throughput, scalable smart contract execution using sharding technology. Built to support dApps in gaming, DeFi, and NFTs, [Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com/) processes transactions efficiently with low fees. Its native token, **ZIL**, powers transactions, staking, and governance. 

## Key Features
- **Sharding Technology**: Divides the network into smaller nodes (shards) to process up to 2,828 TPS, surpassing Ethereum (~25 TPS).
- **Scilla Language**: Uses a secure, custom smart contract language to minimize vulnerabilities.
- **Proof-of-Work + PoS**: Combines PoW for miner identity with pBFT (practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) for consensus.
- **Ecosystem**: Trades on 97+ exchanges (e.g., Binance, HTX) and 150+ markets, with wallet support like ZilPay and Ledger.

## ZIL Token
- **Purpose**: Used for transaction fees, staking, governance, and incentivizing miners.
- **Supply**: ~19.8B ZIL in circulation, with a maximum supply of 21B.
- **Contract Address**: Native to Zilliqa; [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zilliqa) [CMC](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zilliqa/).

## Who Are the Founders of ZIL?

Zilliqa was co-founded by **Xinshu Dong**, **Amrit Kumar**, and **Max Kantelia**, researchers from the National University of Singapore. Launched via a $22M ICO in 2017, Zilliqa is backed by the Zilliqa Foundation and governed by a community-driven model with input from ZIL stakers.

## What Makes ZIL Unique?

Zilliqa stands out in Web3:
- **Scalability via Sharding**: Processes transactions in parallel, enabling linear scaling as the network grows.
- **Eco-Friendly Consensus**: Uses less energy than traditional PoW, with pBFT reducing environmental impact.
- **Gaming and NFT Hub**: Powers dApps like ZilSwap (DeFi) and Xcademy (NFTs), with ~$10M TVL.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Scillaâ€™s formal verification enhances smart contract security, appealing to enterprise use cases.

## ZIL Network Upgrades (2025)
- **Zilliqa 2.0 (Q2 2025)**: Enhanced sharding and EVM compatibility, boosting dApp interoperability.
- **Layer-2 Rollups (March 2025)**: Introduced testnet for Zilliqa rollups, reducing fees by 25% for high-throughput dApps.
- **NFT Marketplace V2 (June 2025)**: Upgraded Xcademy, increasing NFT trading volume by 15%.
- 
## How Is ZIL Secured?

Zilliqa and ZIL are secured through:
- **Hybrid PoW/pBFT**: PoW establishes miner identity, while pBFT ensures consensus with ~70% node honesty.
- **Smart Contract Audits**: Scilla contracts audited by firms like Quantstamp for security.
- **Staking Security**: ~40% of ZIL is staked, aligning incentives for validators (gZIL governance tokens sunset in 2024).
- **Decentralized Governance**: Community proposals drive upgrades, reducing centralized control.

## Conclusion

**Zilliqa (ZIL)** is a scalable layer-1 blockchain, leveraging sharding and Scilla for secure, high-throughput dApps. With 19.8B circulating supply, and 97+ exchange listings, Zilliqa powers gaming, DeFi, and NFTs. Its 2025 upgrades like Zilliqa 2.0 and eco-friendly consensus position it as a competitive Web3 platform, though it faces challenges from newer layer-1s.
